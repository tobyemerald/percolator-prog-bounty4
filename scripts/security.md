# Security findings — 2026-05-20 v16 all-public-API sweep

## Standing public-API adversary model

Every externally callable instruction tag is an attack surface until proven
otherwise. Future sweeps must start by classifying each public API as
adversarial input, even when the instruction is intended for keepers, cranks,
permissionless market creators, liquidation searchers, or operational
maintenance.

For every public tag, explicitly answer:

- Who is allowed to call it, and is that enforced by signer/account ownership
  checks before any mutation or token movement?
- Which scalar arguments can move prices, mark liveness, balances, authority
  state, market lifecycle, or health certificates?
- Which account metas can redirect custody, choose an oracle, choose a domain,
  select a portfolio, or earn a reward?
- If the caller is permissionless, what prevents them from choosing values that
  create liquidations, release PnL, strand funds, refresh stale markets, delay
  resolution, drain insurance/backing, or close/reuse someone else's market
  state?
- Are tests proving both rejection of malicious inputs and recoverability of
  legitimate flows after the rejection condition?

Do not use "honest keeper", "honest crank", "manual oracle", or "operator will
pass the right value" as a safety assumption for a public instruction. If a
public API needs an oracle price, it must consume an authenticated oracle state
or an authority-gated oracle update, not a caller-supplied price-like argument.

## Twenty-sixth pass — shared-vault insurance domain isolation

**Status:** PASS_SAFE_WITH_FIXED_ENGINE. Upgraded the engine to
`8e0e3f858fa07b44434d1ff2e4630266432cdb21`, which isolates v16 insurance
domain budgets. The previous unsafe shape was deeper than a wrapper-only
withdrawal guard: new or empty domains could carry effectively unbounded
budget accounting, so a locally authorized domain operation could spend from
the shared SPL insurance vault even when that domain had not actually been
funded.

Target invariant:

```text
The physical insurance vault may be shared by the market group, but every
spendable insurance unit must be budgeted to one explicit domain. An oracle,
insurance operator, liquidator, or permissionless market creator for domain D
may destroy or withdraw only D's funded budget. It must not be able to consume
domain 0/1 market-0 insurance or any other asset's domain budget through a
new, stale, manually priced, or malicious-oracle asset.
```

Engine-side fix reviewed:

- PASS 1: new domain budgets default to zero, not "all global vault TVL".
- PASS 2: the shape invariant accounts for every live domain's remaining
  budget (`budget - spent`) and rejects states where total remaining domain
  budget exceeds aggregate `group.insurance`.
- PASS 3: per-domain withdrawal still requires the configured local insurance
  operator/authority, but that authority is now limited by the domain's funded
  remaining budget rather than the shared vault balance.
- PASS 4: liquidation and bankruptcy insurance draw through the same domain
  budget accounting. A malicious local oracle can still bankrupt its own
  domain, but cannot source the loss from unrelated domains.

Wrapper/API sweep:

- PASS 5: `TopUpInsurance` credits market-0 domains and aggregate insurance
  one-for-one. It does not silently grant spendable budget to dynamic domains.
- PASS 6: `TopUpInsuranceDomain` credits only the selected domain and aggregate
  insurance. It is the explicit way to fund nonzero asset-domain insurance.
- PASS 7: permissionless asset activation/reuse installs asset-local
  authorities but leaves the new local insurance domains at zero unless the
  init fee is intentionally routed to market 0.
- PASS 8: `WithdrawInsuranceDomain` cannot be made safe from the owner of that
  domain's own oracle and insurance authority, but the fixed budget invariant
  makes that risk domain-local.
- PASS 9: the shared SPL vault is acceptable only as custody. It is not a
  permission boundary; the permission boundary is the engine's per-domain
  budget ledger plus the post-mutation shape validation.
- PASS 10: fee and recovery paths that intentionally redirect value to market
  0 must continue to be explicit policy choices. They should never be modeled
  as generic "any domain may spend the group vault" authority.

Regression coverage added:

```bash
cargo test --test v16_cu \
  v16_bpf_permissionless_asset_cannot_withdraw_unrelated_domain_insurance \
  -- --nocapture

cargo test --test v16_cu \
  v16_bpf_permissionless_oracle_liquidation_uses_only_its_own_domain_insurance \
  -- --nocapture
```

The first LiteSVM regression recreates the reported cross-domain withdrawal
shape: victim domains fund the shared vault, an attacker permissionlessly
creates a new asset with local authority over its own domains, and attempted
withdrawals from those unfunded attacker domains must fail without moving
victim insurance. The second LiteSVM regression covers the deeper surface: a
malicious local oracle makes its own asset liquidatable and proves liquidation
spends only that asset's funded domain budget, leaving market-0 and other
victim domain budgets/spent counters unchanged.

## Twenty-fifth pass — permissionless market shutdown/reuse lifecycle

**Status:** PASS_SAFE. Added an end-to-end regression for the lifecycle where a
permissionless creator pays the market-init fee, opens an isolated secondary
market, users abandon positions, the base market admin shuts the asset down,
the timeout gates public cleanup, asset-domain funds are recovered into market
0 buckets, the asset slot is retired, and the same index is reused with a fresh
monotonic market id.

Target invariant:

```text
After an admin freezes a nonzero asset into shutdown Recovery, users keep a
configured exit window. Before that window elapses, permissionless abandoned
cleanup rejects without mutation. After the timeout, any cranker can close
remaining opposite-side abandoned exposure at the frozen shutdown mark, without
caller-priced liquidation or health-state assumptions. Once local exposure and
asset-domain balances are empty, admin can retire the slot and permissionless
reactivation must assign a new market_id before that index can host a new
market.
```

API-by-API disposition:

- PASS 1: permissionless activation requires the configured init fee, accepts
  only the primary collateral mint, credits the fee into market 0 insurance
  domains, and installs asset-local insurance/backing/oracle authorities.
- PASS 2: `UpdateAssetLifecycle(action=SHUTDOWN)` is base-admin-only, rejects
  market 0, requires a nonzero force-close delay, freezes to the stored
  effective mark, and stamps shutdown liveness into the asset profile.
- PASS 3: the timeout is real: owner-signed risk-reducing trades remain
  available during the window, while `ForceCloseAbandonedAsset` before
  `force_close_delay_slots` rejects and leaves both portfolios plus market state
  unchanged.
- PASS 4: post-timeout abandoned cleanup is public but not caller-priced.
  `ForceCloseAbandonedAsset` requires a cranker signer, two distinct writable
  portfolios, opposite-side active legs for the shutdown asset, matching current
  market ids, and uses only the frozen shutdown mark.
- PASS 5: the forced close path is not health-gated, so it can close abandoned
  opposite-side positions whether or not they are liquidatable from a margin
  perspective. The portfolios must still validate against the current market;
  the path cannot invent a counterparty or close unrelated/stale-market legs.
- PASS 6: after all exposure is gone, the base admin can drain the shutdown
  asset's domain insurance and backing buckets, then re-deposit those recovered
  funds into market 0 insurance/backing buckets through the ordinary top-up
  custody paths.
- PASS 7: retire requires the shutdown timeout and empty asset lifecycle state,
  including zero local insurance domains and zero local backing buckets.
- PASS 8: reactivation of the retired index by a permissionless creator consumes
  the free slot before append, charges a new init fee, resets local domain
  state, and assigns `group.next_market_id`; stale legs from the old market id
  cannot bind to the reused slot.

```

## Twenty-fourth pass — asset shutdown public-API sweep

**Status:** PASS_SAFE. Re-walked the public API surface after adding
asset-scoped shutdown and abandoned-position force close. The new tag is
attacker-reachable and is safe only because it is permissionless progress
against a previously admin-frozen market, not caller-selected price movement.

Updated decoded public API inventory:

```text
64 ForceCloseAbandonedAsset
```

API-by-API disposition for the new shutdown flow:

- PASS 1: `UpdateAssetLifecycle(action=SHUTDOWN)` is admin-only, rejects market
  0, requires a configured nonzero force-close delay, freezes to the stored
  effective mark, and stores the shutdown slot in the isolated asset profile.
- PASS 2: shutdown does not resolve the whole slab. It only moves the selected
  secondary asset into `Recovery`, preserving other asset lifecycles and
  authorities.
- PASS 3: user voluntary exits remain owner-signed bilateral trades and are
  permitted only when they reduce risk against the frozen mark.
- PASS 4: `ForceCloseAbandonedAsset` is permissionless but requires a cranker
  signer, two distinct writable portfolio accounts, the target asset in
  shutdown `Recovery`, and the configured timeout to have elapsed.
- PASS 5: force close does not accept a caller-selected price. It uses the
  frozen `effective_price` captured at shutdown and rejects zero/invalid marks.
- PASS 6: force close only matches opposite-side active legs and caps progress
  to the minimum abandoned quantity, so it cannot create new exposure or
  unbalance long/short open interest.
- PASS 7: forced closure validates both portfolios against the market before
  and after mutation, including market ids, so a retired/reused slot cannot
  attach old positions to a new market instance.
- PASS 8: local insurance/backing authorities and the slab admin can drain a
  shutdown market only after the timeout and only after local position/loss
  state is empty; the shutdown drain path is allowed through live stale flags so
  stale frozen markets are recoverable.
- PASS 9: admin drain uses admin-owned token destinations and admin-bound
  optional ledgers; local drain keeps the existing local domain-authority
  ledger semantics.
- PASS 10: admin retire is a fallback only when the signer is not the asset
  authority, the shutdown timeout has elapsed, and the full asset lifecycle
  state is empty, including insurance budgets and backing buckets.
- PASS 11: after cleanup and retire, permissionless creators must consume the
  freed slot before append. Reuse assigns a fresh market id, resets local
  domain budgets/backing state, installs new per-market authorities, and routes
  the new init fee back to market 0.

## Twenty-third pass — all public API adversary re-sweep

**Status:** PASS_SAFE. Re-walked every decoded v16 instruction tag through the
dispatcher and handler families after the AuthMark/EwmaMark split. No new code
patch was required in this pass.

Decoded public API inventory:

62 ConfigureAuthMark
63 PushAuthMark
```

API-by-API disposition:

- PASS 1: ABI decoding is still fail-closed. Unknown tags, truncated payloads,
  and trailing bytes reject, so legacy/manual-price payloads cannot be
  reinterpreted as valid public crank input.
- PASS 2: market creation binds the market account to the program owner,
  validates the base SPL mint, seeds the base oracle state, and initializes all
  authorities from the market creator signer. No follow-on public API can use an
  uninitialized market because account headers and owner checks gate every
  handler.
- PASS 3: portfolio and custody APIs bind stored portfolio provenance to both
  the market id and portfolio account id. Owner-signed flows (`Deposit`,
  `Withdraw`, `TradeNoCpi`, `TradeCpi`, `ClosePortfolio`,
  `ConvertReleasedPnl`, recovery helpers) require the stored owner where value
  or risk can move.
- PASS 4: inbound token movement is primary-mint-only for deposits, insurance
  top-ups, backing top-ups, cure deposits, and permissionless market init fees.
  Outbound token movement accepts only configured withdrawal mints, requires
  destination/vault mint equality, and requires the vault PDA token account to
  have no delegate or close authority.
- PASS 5: `TradeNoCpi` requires both portfolio owners to sign and rejects same
  account self-trades. `TradeCpi` derives a matcher delegate PDA, validates the
  matcher return against request id/account/asset/oracle price/size, enforces
  the caller limit price, and rejects tail accounts that alias wrapper-owned
  core state.
- PASS 6: `PermissionlessCrank`, `SyncMaintenanceFee`, `FinalizeResetSide`,
  `CloseResolved`, and `ClaimResolvedPayoutTopup` are intentionally public, but
  each output is bounded by stored market/portfolio state. Rewards are optional,
  capped by configured bps, and either retained by insurance or credited to a
  verified cranker/owner portfolio.
- PASS 7: no public API accepts an unauthenticated oracle price. Hybrid reads
  verify oracle account owner, feed key, staleness, monotonic publish time, and
  confidence. AuthMark and EwmaMark updates require the configured mark/oracle
  authority. Raw manual mode is only a stored engine price path and cannot be
  advanced by `PermissionlessCrank`.
- PASS 8: asset lifecycle APIs keep dynamic markets isolated. The asset
  authority controls normal lifecycle changes; permissionless activation is
  available only when the base init fee is nonzero, the expected integer fee is
  paid, and any retired free slot is consumed before append.
- PASS 9: insurance and backing APIs resolve authorities from the target asset
  profile, not from global state. Domain ledgers are bound to market,
  authority, and domain; withdrawal paths reject stressed/live unsafe states and
  terminal withdrawals only debit budgets belonging to the withdrawing
  authority.
- PASS 10: admin/policy APIs are authority-gated and bounded. Bps fields reject
  values above 10_000, permissionless stale/force-close windows are nonzero and
  capped, live admin burn is blocked unless permissionless resolution is
  configured, and base-unit mint updates require the base-unit authority plus
  real SPL mint accounts.
- PASS 11: resolved and terminal close APIs do not let callers redirect value.
  Resolved payouts are paid only to token accounts owned by the stored
  portfolio owner; `CloseSlab` requires admin authority, resolved mode, zero
  engine vault/accounting balances, and then drains only stranded vault tokens
  to admin-owned token accounts.
- PASS 12: recoverability invariants remain covered by tests: nonzero
  domain insurance/backing blocks retire/close, while authority-gated withdrawal
  paths can drive isolated domain budgets to zero after positions close.

## Twenty-first pass — all public instruction adversary sweep

**Status:** PASS_SAFE. The public crank price field was the concrete exploit
class fixed in this pass; the broader sweep re-walked every decoded instruction
as attacker-reachable public API. Verification completed with
`cargo kani --tests` reporting 33 successfully verified harnesses and 0
failures.

Scope by adversary boundary:

- Authority-gated setup/config: `InitMarket`, `UpdateAuthority`,
  `UpdateInsurancePolicy`, `UpdateLiquidationFeePolicy`,
  `UpdateMaintenanceFeePolicy`, `UpdateBackingFeePolicy`,
  `UpdateTradeFeePolicy`, `UpdateFeeRedirectPolicy`,
  `UpdateMarketInitFeePolicy`, `ConfigurePermissionlessResolve`,
  `UpdateBaseUnitMints`, `SwapSecondaryForPrimary`.
- Owner-signed portfolio/custody: `InitPortfolio`, `Deposit`, `Withdraw`,
  `TradeNoCpi`, `TradeCpi`, `ClosePortfolio`, `ConvertReleasedPnl`,
  `CureAndCancelClose`, `ForfeitRecoveryLeg`, `RebalanceReduce`.
- Domain insurance/backing authority paths: `TopUpInsurance`,
  `TopUpInsuranceDomain`, `WithdrawInsuranceLimited`, `WithdrawInsurance`,
  `WithdrawInsuranceDomain`, `TopUpBackingBucket`,
  `WithdrawBackingBucket`, `WithdrawBackingBucketEarnings`,
  `SyncBackingDomainLedger`, `SyncInsuranceLedger`.
- Oracle and lifecycle: `ConfigureHybridOracle`, `ConfigureAuthMark`,
  `PushAuthMark`, `ConfigureEwmaMark`, `PushEwmaMark`,
  `UpdateAssetLifecycle`.
- Deliberately permissionless progress/recovery: `PermissionlessCrank`,
  `SyncMaintenanceFee`, `ResolveStalePermissionless`, `CloseResolved`,
  `ClaimResolvedPayoutTopup`, `FinalizeResetSide`.
- Resolved/admin terminal paths: `ResolveMarket`, `CloseSlab`,
  `RefineResolvedUnreceiptedBound`.

API-by-API disposition:

- PASS 1: all decoded tags reject trailing bytes and truncation; legacy tag `5`
  payloads that still append a manual/effective price are invalid rather than
  reinterpreted as another field.
- PASS 2: no permissionless API now accepts a scalar that can directly move an
  oracle price. `PermissionlessCrank` consumes authenticated hybrid feeds,
  authority-pushed `AuthMark`/`EwmaMark` state, or the already stored
  manual/raw engine price.
- PASS 3: manual/raw oracle markets cannot be advanced by a public caller's
  price. A market creator who wants operator-pushed prices must use the
  per-market oracle authority through `AuthMark`, `EwmaMark`, or
  `ConfigureHybridOracle`.
- PASS 4: external oracle configuration is authority-gated per asset, verifies
  provided feed accounts against stored feed keys, and does not advance the
  group-wide loss accrual anchor while any asset has open position/loss state.
- PASS 5: portfolio custody paths require the stored owner signer and account
  provenance before mutation; deposits, cure deposits, insurance top-ups, and
  backing top-ups accept only the current primary base-unit mint.
- PASS 6: withdrawals and resolved payouts can use either configured base-unit
  mint, but only when destination and vault token-account mints match and the
  vault is owned by the wrapper PDA with no delegate or close authority.
- PASS 7: domain insurance and backing APIs resolve authorities from the target
  domain's asset profile. Dynamic markets therefore carry their own insurance,
  insurance-operator, backing, and oracle authorities rather than using a
  global authority surface.
- PASS 8: permissionless market activation is fee-gated when the base fee is
  above zero, the fee doubles every 32 market slots without floating point, and
  permissionless creators must consume a retired free slot before appending.
- PASS 9: permissionless settlement, stale resolve, resolved payout top-up,
  finalized reset-side, and forced close cannot redirect value to the caller;
  payouts are bound to stored portfolio owners or rewards are capped to retained
  fee growth.
- PASS 10: terminal drain/close paths preserve recoverability: nonzero
  insurance/backing/domain budgets block retirement or slab close, but covered
  authority paths can drive those balances to zero after positions close.

## Twenty-second pass — AuthMark/EwmaMark oracle API split

**Status:** PASS_SAFE. `cargo kani --tests` completed with 33 successfully
verified harnesses and 0 failures. This pass treats the new AuthMark public APIs
and the renamed EwmaMark APIs as attacker-reachable oracle-management surfaces.

Target invariant:

```text
AuthMark is a direct authority-pushed mark with no EWMA or feed-tail
configuration. EwmaMark is the authority-pushed smoothed mark. Public cranks and
trades must not be able to rewrite either mark without the configured mark
authority.
```

API-by-API disposition:

- PASS 1: `ConfigureAuthMark` and `PushAuthMark` are distinct public tags
  (`62` and `63`) with strict decoding, truncation rejection, and trailing-byte
  rejection coverage.
- PASS 2: `ConfigureAuthMark` exposes only `asset_index`, authenticated slot,
  and mark. It cannot smuggle EWMA halflife/min-fee, oracle feed ids, unit
  conversion, confidence filters, or hybrid stale timers.
- PASS 3: AuthMark profile validation requires the stored direct mark and
  target mark to match, requires both to remain inside the engine oracle-price
  envelope, and rejects any nonzero EWMA or external-oracle configuration.
- PASS 4: AuthMark configuration is authority-gated by the same per-asset oracle
  authority model as other price-managed modes; base asset configuration remains
  admin-gated, non-base configuration remains per-asset oracle-authority gated.
- PASS 5: `PushAuthMark` requires the configured mark authority, authenticates
  liveness with `Clock::get()` instead of caller `now_slot`, and rejects stale
  or over-limit marks before mutation.
- PASS 6: `PermissionlessCrank` consumes only the stored AuthMark/EwmaMark state
  and has no public price-like scalar. AuthMark and EwmaMark both pass through
  the same engine price-movement cap on exposed markets.
- PASS 7: `TradeNoCpi`/`TradeCpi` cannot rewrite AuthMark state or charge
  EWMA mark-movement fees in AuthMark mode; the mark moves only through
  `PushAuthMark`.
- PASS 8: Existing EwmaMark behavior is preserved under the new name:
  `ConfigureEwmaMark`/`PushEwmaMark` still use halflife/min-fee smoothing and
  dynamic mark-movement fee tests still pass.
- PASS 9: Hybrid remains external-oracle-primary with EWMA fallback; it was not
  collapsed into AuthMark or EwmaMark, so feed-tail/staleness/confidence policy
  remains isolated to `ConfigureHybridOracle`.
- PASS 10: Repository terminology now classifies legacy mark-mode references as
  AuthMark or EwmaMark, and the shared authority is named
  `mark_authority`/`AUTHORITY_MARK`.

Regression coverage retained for this pass:

```

## Twentieth pass — public crank price-input audit

**Status:** fixed locally; final proof run is tracked by the Twenty-first pass.
The prior sweep missed an oracle-auth boundary because it treated
`PermissionlessCrank`'s caller-supplied manual price as a benign input/test
fixture instead of modeling the crank caller as an attacker.

Corrected invariant:

```text
Permissionless public crank APIs may advance time, funding, settlement, and
liquidation work, but they must not contain any unauthenticated price input.
All price movement must come from either an external verified oracle profile or
an authority-gated `AuthMark`/`EwmaMark` update.
```

Why the old sweep missed it:

- The branch checklist accepted a "one honest crank" assumption for
  permissionless progress, which is not a valid custody or liquidation trust
  boundary.
- The F11 fix classified non-base manual prices as caller-supplied per-asset
  price inputs and focused on preventing cross-asset oracle pollution, but did
  not ask whether a public caller should be able to supply any price at all.
- Tests covered malformed prices and stale slots as rejection cases, but also
  used public crank prices to manufacture legitimate test price moves. That
  encoded the attack surface as expected behavior.
- The sweep emphasized accounting after a corrupt price entered the engine; it
  did not require an authority/liveness proof before price data reached the
  engine.

Required retained coverage for this class:

- Public crank ABI has no manual/effective price field and rejects legacy
  trailing price bytes.
- Raw/manual oracle profiles cannot be moved by `PermissionlessCrank`; they can
  only reuse the currently stored engine price.
- Authorized `AuthMark`/`EwmaMark` updates remain the path for operator-pushed
  markets, and public cranks consume only that stored mark state.
- Liquidation and released-PnL tests that need price movement use an
  authority-gated oracle update before the public crank.

## Nineteenth pass — primary/secondary base-unit SPL custody API

**Status:** fixed with TDD, then `PASS_SAFE` on the new base-unit mint
configuration, withdrawal mint selection, and authority-only migration swap.

Target invariant:

```text
Market 0 stores a primary base-unit SPL mint and an optional secondary base-unit
SPL mint. All inbound custody that increases wrapper accounting must use the
current primary mint. Outbound custody may pay from either configured mint, but
destination and vault mints must match. The base-unit authority alone may change
the primary/secondary mint pair or atomically replace N secondary vault units
with N primary vault units without changing engine accounting.
```

TDD and verification:

```bash
cargo test --test v16_wrapper base_unit -- --nocapture
cargo test --test v16_wrapper raw_wrapper_config_invalid_values_fail_closed -- --nocapture
cargo test --no-run --test v16_kani
cargo build-sbf --no-default-features
cargo test
git diff --check
```

Security pass results:

- PASS 1: persisted config rejects an empty primary mint and rejects a secondary
  mint equal to the primary mint; unconfigured secondary remains disabled.
- PASS 2: `UpdateBaseUnitMints` requires the live `base_unit_authority` signer,
  validates both supplied accounts as SPL mints, and stores distinct primary and
  secondary mint ids.
- PASS 3: `AUTHORITY_BASE_UNIT` rotation follows the existing dual-signature
  authority update pattern, and the stale prior authority cannot change mints.
- PASS 4: `Deposit`, insurance top-ups, domain insurance top-ups, backing
  top-ups, cure deposits, and permissionless market init fees still accept only
  the current primary mint.
- PASS 5: user withdrawals and resolved payout withdrawals accept either
  configured mint only when destination and vault token-account mints match.
- PASS 6: insurance, domain-insurance, backing-principal, backing-earnings, and
  close-slab withdrawal paths share the same configured-mint outbound checks.
- PASS 7: outbound vault accounts still require the wrapper vault PDA owner,
  initialized token state, no delegate, and no close authority.
- PASS 8: `SwapSecondaryForPrimary` rejects zero amounts, unauthorized signers,
  short primary source balances, missing secondary configuration, and bad token
  programs before moving tokens.
- PASS 9: `SwapSecondaryForPrimary` transfers N primary units into the primary
  vault and N secondary units out of the secondary vault under PDA signature,
  without mutating engine vault/capital/insurance accounting.
- PASS 10: tags `60` and `61` have Kani encode/decode coverage, trailing-byte
  rejection, and truncation rejection.

## Eighteenth pass — domain-scoped backing residual fee API

**Status:** fixed with TDD, then `PASS_SAFE` on the exposed policy, lifecycle,
NoCPI, and CPI trade paths. I swept the backing-authority-controlled residual
fee as a source-domain custody boundary.

Target invariant:

```text
The backing authority may charge a bounded reservation fee only when a trade
locks new counterparty backing in that same source domain. The fee must not be a
global trade-fee floor, must not bypass margin health, must accrue back to the
same backing bucket, and must survive unrelated oracle/lifecycle changes.
```

Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper v16_wrapper_backing_fee -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper -- --test-threads=1
cargo check --tests
cargo build-sbf --no-default-features
```

Coverage:

- `UpdateBackingFeePolicy { domain, fee_bps }` is gated by the live
  `backing_bucket_authority`; stale admin and unrelated signers reject after
  authority rotation.
- `domain` must be within configured market capacity, and `fee_bps` must be
  `<= 10_000` and `<= group.config.max_trading_fee_bps`.
- `TradeNoCpi` and `TradeCpi` do not use the backing policy as a minimum trade
  fee when no new counterparty backing lien is created.
- When a trade does create a new source-domain counterparty-backing lien, the
  wrapper charges the borrowing account using the post-trade health certificate,
  rejects if the fee would leave the borrower below initial margin, and credits
  the fee back into that same source-domain backing bucket.
- The no-CPI and matcher-CPI trade paths are covered with the same lien delta
  and fee-credit behavior.
- Corrupted persisted fee fields above `10_000` fail closed before matcher CPI.
- Non-base `ConfigureEwmaMark`, `ConfigureHybridOracle`, and asset
  retire/reactivate lifecycle resets preserve the backing authority's domain fee
  policy. Oracle profile changes may reset oracle data, but cannot silently
  erase residual-fee policy or desynchronize `backing_trade_fee_policy_count`.

One hardening issue was found and fixed in this pass: non-base oracle
reconfiguration and lifecycle profile resets were rebuilding
`AssetOracleProfileV16` with zero backing-fee fields. That let the asset/oracle
authority erase a fee set by `backing_bucket_authority`, and it could leave the
global policy-count optimization inconsistent. The profile reset paths now
preserve `backing_trade_fee_bps_long/short`, and the regression covers EwmaMark,
hybrid, retire, and reactivation resets.

## Seventeenth pass — corrupt-oracle source PnL and cross-margin exit cap

**Status:** `PASS_SAFE` with added wrapper regressions. I scanned the path where
an admin adds or configures a market whose oracle is later corrupt, causing a
portfolio to acquire manufactured positive PnL, then attempts to use cross
margin to convert and withdraw that PnL against unrelated value.

Target invariant:

```text
For source-attributed positive PnL, exit is capped by support available to that
same source domain: opposing-side capital/backing for that asset side, or
explicit backing/insurance credit reserved to that domain. Unrelated backing,
general insurance, and unrelated cross-margin capital must not make the corrupt
asset claim withdrawable.
```

Regression probes added:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper v16_wrapper_exploited -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper cross_margin_source_claims -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

Coverage:

- a dynamically added asset manufactures source-domain PnL with no same-domain
  backing; `ConvertReleasedPnl` rejects even when unrelated backing and general
  insurance exist;
- the same account can still withdraw only its existing deposited capital, not
  the unsupported source claim;
- a corrupt added asset with 100 units of source PnL and only 30 units of
  same-domain backing converts exactly 30 units; unrelated domain backing stays
  untouched and over-withdrawal rejects;
- mixed claims in one cross-margin portfolio convert only the legitimately
  backed claim and leave the unbacked corrupt-domain claim outstanding and
  non-withdrawable.

No wrapper bug was found in this class. The relevant engine behavior is the
source-credit ledger: source claims carry a domain-specific market id, and
conversion uses `min(global support, account_source_realizable_support(...))`
before consuming source credit. The wrapper-level tests pin that behavior at
the public custody boundary.

## Sixteenth pass — live insurance policy default and full-drain cap

**Status:** fixed with TDD. I treated the submitted
`WithdrawInsuranceLimited` report as untrusted and checked the live policy
against local v16 code. The report was valid in the non-deposit-only live
withdrawal lane: init enabled `insurance_withdraw_max_bps = 10_000` with
`cooldown_slots = 0`, so the configured `insurance_operator` could withdraw the
entire live insurance balance in one instruction while the market was healthy.

Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper v16_wrapper_insurance -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper withdraw_insurance -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

Policy now enforced:

- live limited insurance withdrawal is disabled by default
  (`insurance_withdraw_max_bps = 0`);
- non-deposit-only live policies must have `max_bps < 10_000` and a nonzero
  cooldown;
- deposit-only mode may use `max_bps = 10_000` and zero cooldown because the
  budget is capped to tracked `TopUpInsurance` principal;
- `WithdrawInsuranceLimited` is live-only. Resolved terminal insurance uses
  `WithdrawInsurance` and the `insurance_authority` key.

## Fifteenth pass — backing bucket withdrawal API

**Status:** implemented and `PASS_SAFE` under the live-insurance-withdrawal
threat model. I added `WithdrawBackingBucket { domain, amount }` as tag `50`
and swept it as a token-custody and source-credit boundary.

TDD coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper withdraw_backing_bucket -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

Regression probes:

- wrong signer cannot withdraw from a backing bucket;
- zero amount rejects;
- wrong destination owner, wrong vault authority, and wrong vault mint reject
  without market mutation;
- partial withdrawal debits only `fresh_unliened_backing_num`,
  `source_credit.fresh_reserved_backing_num`, and `group.vault`;
- over-withdraw rejects;
- withdrawal rejects while any source claim exists for the domain, preventing
  dilution of backed positive-PnL claims;
- withdrawal rejects under the same live stress locks used by limited insurance
  withdrawal: bankruptcy h-lock, threshold stress, loss-stale, or recovery
  reason;
- full clean drain leaves the bucket in `Empty` shape with `expiry_slot = 0`;
- decode/encode coverage added to the v16 Kani harness for the new tag.

Design boundary:

```text
Backing withdrawals are not a general protocol-surplus withdrawal. They can
remove only explicit fresh, unencumbered bucket backing for a source domain.
If the bucket has already been consumed, impaired, liened to claims, or moved
out of the fresh bucket shape, the withdrawal path fails closed.
```

The API intentionally mirrors limited live insurance withdrawal for health and
custody checks, but it does not reuse the insurance bps/cooldown policy because
the withdrawable amount is already capped to explicit unencumbered backing
deposits rather than insurance surplus.

## Fourteenth pass — EwmaMark mark upper-bound enforcement

**Status:** fixed. I treated the submitted EwmaMark over-limit mark report as
untrusted and verified it locally. The report was valid: `PushEwmaMark`
rejected zero marks but did not reject marks above
`percolator::MAX_ORACLE_PRICE`, and persisted EwmaMark/hybrid profile validation
only required nonzero `mark_ewma_e6`.

Red tests added first:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper ewma_mark -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

Both new regressions failed before the patch:

- `v16_wrapper_ewma_mark_profiles_reject_prices_above_engine_max`
- `v16_wrapper_push_ewma_mark_rejects_over_max_input_and_preserves_state`

Fix:

- `validate_wrapper_config` and `validate_asset_oracle_profile` now require
  EwmaMark/hybrid `mark_ewma_e6` and `oracle_target_price_e6` to be in the engine
  oracle-price envelope: `1..=percolator::MAX_ORACLE_PRICE`.
- `ConfigureEwmaMark` rejects an initial mark above the engine max before
  mutating engine price state.
- `PushEwmaMark` rejects both over-limit input marks and over-limit EWMA
  outputs before persisting the profile.

Impact classification: authority-scoped operational DoS, not arbitrary-user
theft. A compromised or buggy mark authority could previously persist an
over-limit target that later made crank/trade paths fail against engine price
invariants. The fix makes the wrapper fail closed at the same boundary enforced
for external oracle readers and engine effective prices.

Verification:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1
```

Results: formatting check passed, all 140 v16 wrapper tests passed, and the
full normal cargo suite passed.

## Thirteenth pass — deployment permutation feature matrix

**Status:** `PASS_SAFE`. I generated `/tmp/matrix.md` as an exhaustive
deployment-feature matrix over security-relevant branch combinations, then swept
each entry against ten probe categories:

1. auth/provenance,
2. custody/conservation,
3. oracle/freshness/clamp/recovery,
4. fee/loss ordering,
5. trade/risk/margin,
6. permissionless crank progress,
7. lifecycle/reuse,
8. backing/insurance,
9. decode/layout/overflow,
10. CU boundedness.

The matrix is exhaustive by equivalence class rather than by raw numeric
Cartesian product: manual, EwmaMark, and hybrid oracle modes; Pyth/Switchboard/
Chainlink one-, two-, and three-leg profiles; fresh/soft-stale/hard-stale
states; live/recovery/resolved modes; active/drain-only/retired asset
lifecycles; flat/single-leg/multi-leg/source-backed/resolved portfolios;
maintenance, dynamic EWMA, liquidation, and insurance-fee policies; all four
permissionless crank actions; matcher CPI and no-CPI trade paths; and dense CU
worst cases.

Regression evidence:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_cu -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1
```

Results:

- `v16_cu`: 18 passed.
- Full normal cargo suite: 1 unit test, 18 CU tests, 138 v16 wrapper tests, and
  doctests passed.
- `tests/v16_kani.rs` is not a normal cargo test target; Kani proofs were not
  re-run in this pass.

No new deterministic fund-loss, unfair insurance extraction, market-brick,
stale-market-id reuse, matcher-CPI privilege escalation, or worst-case CU
regression was found in that pass. Its crank trust model is superseded by the
standing public-API adversary model above; public crank inputs must be treated
as attacker controlled.

## Twelfth pass — new portfolio maintenance-fee anchor

**Status:** fixed. I confirmed a real wrapper bug in `InitPortfolio`: new
portfolios were initialized with `last_fee_slot = 0`, so the first
permissionless maintenance-fee sync could charge from genesis instead of from
portfolio creation time.

Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper \
  v16_wrapper_init_portfolio_anchors_fee_slot_at_market_current_slot \
  v16_wrapper_init_portfolio_fee_anchor_tracks_crank_and_asset_lifecycle_time \
  -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

The regression first advances a live market to slot `100`, initializes a new
portfolio, deposits capital, then syncs maintenance fees at slot `110`. Before
the fix, the account paid `110` slots of fees and capital fell to `450`.
Correct behavior is `10` slots of fees: capital `950`, insurance `50`.

The follow-up regression repeats the same invariant after market time advances
through two independent surfaces:

- `PermissionlessCrank` on an existing portfolio;
- `UpdateAssetLifecycle` activating a newly appended asset.

Both paths leave the new portfolio owing fees only from its creation slot.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
InitPortfolio seeds last_fee_slot to the authenticated current slot, falling
back to the market group's current slot in unit tests. A portfolio never owes
recurring maintenance fees for slots before the account existed.
```

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. The broader v16 wrapper suite now
covers both live and resolved fee-anchor semantics with this creation-time
cursor.

**Why this was missed:** prior sweeps focused on post-creation public handlers
and most unit fixtures initialized portfolios while the market clock was still
zero. In that shape, a zero fee cursor is indistinguishable from a valid
creation-time cursor, so first-sync tests encoded the bad implementation detail
instead of the product invariant.

**Similar zero-cursor sweep:** I rechecked the other zero-initialized slot and
timestamp fields against current wrapper/API usage.

- `last_good_oracle_slot`, `mark_ewma_last_slot`, and
  `oracle_target_publish_time`: stamped by init/configure/read paths and used
  only for liveness or EWMA transition checks; stale proofs already covered by
  hybrid and permissionless-resolve tests.
- `last_insurance_withdraw_slot`: zero means no prior withdrawal, so the first
  withdrawal is intentionally allowed; cooldown tests cover subsequent
  withdrawals.
- `last_asset_activation_slot`: zero means no prior activation and the first
  activation is intentionally allowed; lifecycle tests cover monotonic market
  ids and non-reuse.
- `source_backing_buckets[*].expiry_slot`: zero means no fresh bucket; nonzero
  topups are engine-validated as `expiry_slot > current_slot`.
- `resolved_slot`: zero is unreachable for resolved behavior until the engine
  resolves the market; resolved-close tests cover fee anchoring at the actual
  resolved slot.
- `group.slot_last` and per-asset `slot_last`: zero is the engine's
  no-exposure initial state. Permissionless crank and cross-asset tests cover
  bounded progress, loss-stale behavior, and no cross-asset fee-anchor aliasing.

No additional user-funds drain, insurance extraction, or market-brick vector was
found in this class.

## Eleventh pass — untrusted Lean/spec-abstraction findings

**Status:** one hardening patch, otherwise `PASS_SAFE`. I treated the submitted
P11/P12/P6/P7/cooldown notes as untrusted and checked them against the local
v16 wrapper, not the external model.

Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper \
  v16_wrapper_update_authority_rotates_admin_with_dual_signature \
  v16_wrapper_update_authority_allows_chained_admin_rotation_without_old_key_reuse \
  v16_wrapper_close_slab_rejects_burned_admin_zero_key \
  v16_wrapper_liquidation_fee_policy_splits_retained_penalty_to_cranker \
  v16_wrapper_liquidation_reward_account_is_optional_and_absent_keeps_fee_in_insurance \
  v16_wrapper_liquidation_reward_never_spends_insurance_needed_for_losses \
  v16_wrapper_insurance_policy_enforces_bps_cap_and_cooldown \
  -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

Findings checked:

- `P11`: local code already rotates authority fields explicitly. The existing
  update-authority tests prove the old admin cannot keep using admin-only
  paths after rotation, and chained rotation does not let either prior key
  recover control.
- `P12`: the all-zero admin signer is impossible on-chain, but it was worth
  hardening the source of truth. Admin-gated wrapper checks now reject
  `admin == 0` explicitly, and the regression forges a zero-key signer in the
  unit harness to prove `CloseSlab` still rejects.
- `P6/P7`: permissionless liquidation reward is not a token-custody transfer.
  The wrapper credits the optional cranker portfolio only from retained
  liquidation fee already booked into insurance, then reasserts public
  invariants. Existing tests cover split reward, absent optional reward
  account, and the case where losses consume the fee so no reward is paid.
- cooldown: `WithdrawInsuranceLimited` uses the authenticated slot or the
  engine slot fallback and persists `last_insurance_withdraw_slot`. Existing
  tests cover the first withdrawal, blocked second withdrawal inside the
  cooldown, and successful withdrawal once the slot gap is sufficient.

**Disposition:** no v16 fund-loss or liveness bug found in these claims. The
only accepted change is proof-hardening of admin-burn semantics so local models
do not need to rely on the SVM fact that the zero pubkey cannot sign.

## Tenth pass — empty-asset oracle configuration vs group loss anchor

**Status:** fixed. I found one wrapper-level cross-asset accounting bug while
re-walking the market-authority/oracle surfaces.

Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper \
  v16_wrapper_configuring_empty_asset_does_not_advance_other_asset_fee_anchor \
  -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

**Attacker/UX model:** a market group has asset `0` with live open interest,
while an operator configures asset `1` before it has positions. Dynamic asset
setup should be allowed; it must not declare unrelated exposed assets
loss-current.

**Original issue:** `ConfigureHybridOracle` and `ConfigureEwmaMark` only
checked that the selected asset was empty. They then set both:

```text
group.current_slot = authenticated_slot
group.slot_last = authenticated_slot
```

Because recurring maintenance fees on nonflat accounts use `group.slot_last` as
the loss-safe anchor, configuring an empty asset could let a later
`SyncMaintenanceFee` charge an asset-0 position up to the new slot before
asset 0 had made its own oracle/funding progress.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
Configuring an empty asset:
  may initialize that asset's raw/effective/funding price and asset slot;
  may advance group.current_slot for authenticated-time monotonicity;
  may advance group.slot_last only when the entire group has no position or
    loss state.

If any configured asset has OI, stale state, B/loss state, stress, h-lock, or
recovery active, the group-wide loss-safe fee anchor is preserved.
```

The retained test covers both `ConfigureEwmaMark` and `ConfigureHybridOracle`
on an empty nonzero asset while asset `0` has open OI, then proves a
permissionless fee sync cannot charge that nonflat asset against the newly
configured slot.

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. Dynamic setup of unused assets remains
available, but it no longer mutates the loss anchor for other assets.

## Ninth pass — every v16 wrapper instruction surface

**Status:** `PASS_SAFE`. I re-enumerated the `Instruction` decoder and the
dispatcher, then walked every handler against the current v16 tests and Kani
coverage. No new fund leak, insurance extraction, stale-market brick, authority
bypass, or cross-asset reuse issue was found.

Scope covered:

- custody and account lifecycle: `InitMarket`, `InitPortfolio`, `Deposit`,
  `Withdraw`, `ClosePortfolio`, `CloseSlab`;
- trading: `TradeNoCpi`, `TradeCpi`, matcher return validation, tail-account
  filtering, arbitrary execution prices, dynamic hybrid/EwmaMark fees;
- permissionless progress: `PermissionlessCrank` refresh, liquidation, B
  settlement, public recovery evidence, cranker reward splits;
- insurance and backing: `TopUpInsurance`, `WithdrawInsurance`,
  `WithdrawInsuranceLimited`, `TopUpBackingBucket`,
  `UpdateInsurancePolicy`, `UpdateLiquidationFeePolicy`;
- market authority/config: all `UpdateAuthority` kinds,
  `ConfigurePermissionlessResolve`, `ConfigureHybridOracle`,
  `ConfigureEwmaMark`, `PushEwmaMark`, `UpdateAssetLifecycle`;
- recovery/resolution: `ResolveMarket`, `ResolveStalePermissionless`,
  `CloseResolved`, `ClaimResolvedPayoutTopup`,
  `RefineResolvedUnreceiptedBound`, `CureAndCancelClose`,
  `ForfeitRecoveryLeg`, `RebalanceReduce`, `FinalizeResetSide`,
  `SyncMaintenanceFee`.

Probe strategy:

- checked signer/writable/owner/provenance boundaries for every token-moving
  and state-mutating instruction;
- checked asset-slot lifecycle edges: disabled, active, drain-only, retired,
  reactivated with a new monotonic market id, stale portfolio legs, stale source
  claims, and stale close-progress ledgers;
- checked per-asset oracle profile edges: manual, hybrid, EwmaMark, retired
  profile reset, nonzero asset profile isolation, duplicate oracle publish
  times, stale fallback, hard stale resolution, and below-floor recovery;
- checked permissionless crank branches with and without cranker reward
  accounts, including invalid recovery reasons, stale slots, invalid prices,
  B settlement without B state, liquidation fee policy, and reward accounting;
- checked trade branches for both direct bilateral and matcher CPI paths:
  zero/i128::MIN size rejection, self-trade rejection, matcher asset echo,
  zero fill, partial fill flags, limit price, fee caps, arbitrary execution
  prices, stale fallback fees, and non-LP user-to-user matching;
- checked resolved and terminal exits for zero-payout ATA deferral,
  owner-token-account payout binding, permissionless close, payout top-up
  claim receipt handling, terminal insurance drain, and slab close.

Retained regression coverage already exercising these branches includes:

```bash
cargo test --release --test v16_wrapper v16_wrapper_security_sweep_ -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --release --lib --tests -- --test-threads=1
cargo kani --tests
```

Important design dispositions confirmed during this pass:

- `CloseResolved` and `ClaimResolvedPayoutTopup` are intentionally
  permissionless, but payouts are bound to the stored portfolio owner token
  account, so third parties cannot redirect funds.
- Nonzero asset oracle profiles may refresh global liveness while active or
  drain-only; retired/reactivated slots reset to manual profiles and cannot
  keep stale liveness or inherited EWMA state.
- `WithdrawInsuranceLimited` is live-only and disabled by default; after
  explicit opt-in it remains blocked while bankruptcy h-lock, threshold stress,
  loss-stale, or recovery is active. Resolved insurance exits use
  `WithdrawInsurance`.
- Keeper liquidation with a cranker reward mirrors the engine's permissionless
  liquidation ordering and only pays from retained liquidation fee growth, not
  from insurance needed for losses.
- Zero-amount deposit/top-up/backing paths are no-ops by policy and have
  retained no-state-drift coverage.

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE`. The sweep did not produce a retained new
regression test because each probe was already covered by an existing wrapper,
CU, or Kani test, or matched an explicitly accepted product policy.

# Security findings — 2026-05-19 v16 three-asset shutdown/reuse sweep

## F11 — Hybrid oracle mode must not price nonzero asset slots (High)

**Status:** fixed locally by scoping the wrapper's configured hybrid/EwmaMark
oracle lane to asset index `0`. Nonzero asset slots now use the per-asset
oracle profile/engine price seen by `PermissionlessCrank` and pay only their
configured base trade fee; they do not inherit asset `0`'s composite/EWMA mark.
The old public caller-supplied price behavior in this entry was superseded by
the Twentieth pass.

Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release \
  v16_wrapper_three_asset_hybrid_prediction_shutdown_reuses_only_prediction_slot \
  -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
cargo test --release v16_wrapper_security_sweep_ -- --test-threads=1
```

**Attacker/UX model:** one market group hosts three assets:

- asset 0: external hybrid index, e.g. `1306/JPY / USD/JPY / SOL/USD`
- asset 1: prediction-style market that resolves, drains, retires, and is
  reused for the next prediction
- asset 2: independent manual/other asset

After asset 1 resolves, accounts may still hold asset-1 positions while also
holding asset-0 and asset-2 positions. The operator wants to drain only asset 1,
retire the slot, then reactivate that slot with a fresh monotonic `market_id`.

**Original issue:** the wrapper stored hybrid oracle configuration at
market-group scope. A soft-stale `PermissionlessCrank` on asset 1 could route
through the hybrid fallback branch and use asset 0's EWMA/composite mark instead
of asset 1's supplied effective price. That could corrupt the prediction
shutdown/reuse flow and make asset 1 dependent on unrelated asset-0 oracle
state.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
Configured hybrid/EwmaMark oracle policy:
  applies to asset_index == 0 only.

For asset_index != 0:
  PermissionlessCrank effective price = stored per-asset oracle/engine state;
  TradeCpi/TradeNoCpi fee = max(caller_fee_bps, trade_fee_base_bps);
  asset-0 mark_ewma_e6/last_good_oracle_slot are not mutated.
```

The retained test also verifies the full prediction-slot lifecycle: risk
increase is blocked after `DrainOnly`, both sides can be cleared while other
assets stay open, retirement is only allowed after OI is zero, reactivation
assigns a new `market_id`, and a stale old-id leg cannot trade on the reused
slot.

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. No cross-asset fund leak or market
brick was found in the three-asset shutdown/reuse path.

# Security findings — 2026-05-13 hybrid after-hours sweep

## F10 — Hybrid stale-fallback fee floor must scale with the next crank segment (Medium)

**Status:** fixed locally by charging the stale-fallback uncertainty floor over
the same bounded segment that the next valid permissionless crank can consume,
not just one slot. Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --no-default-features \
  v14_wrapper_hybrid_after_hours_fee_floor_scales_with_next_crank_segment_budget \
  -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

**Attacker/UX model:** a hybrid after-hours market is soft-stale and the engine
slot is behind the authenticated clock by multiple slots. Consenting traders can
still execute at arbitrary prices, but the next valid crank may move the
effective external index by up to:

```text
max_price_move_bps_per_slot * min(now_slot - slot_last, max_accrual_dt_slots)
```

**Original issue:** stale-fallback trades paid an uncertainty floor of only
`max_price_move_bps_per_slot`. When `max_accrual_dt_slots > 1`, a trader could
enter during stale fallback while paying for a one-slot oracle step even though
the next valid crank could consume a larger bounded segment.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
Hybrid stale-fallback trade fee:
  min_externality_bps >= max_price_move_bps_per_slot
      * max(1, min(authenticated_now_slot - slot_last, max_accrual_dt_slots))
```

The one-slot minimum preserves the existing same-slot uncertainty floor. If the
configured maximum trade fee cannot cover the resulting dynamic fee, the wrapper
rejects rather than silently undercharging.

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. The retained trade fee now covers the
full next-crank price movement budget, and the existing one-slot hybrid tests
continue to pass.

## F9 — Same-slot target-lag crank must not trigger P-last recovery (High)

**Status:** fixed by withholding raw-target recovery evidence from
`permissionless_progress_not_atomic` when the wrapper has no positive-time
bounded segment to advance (`crank_slot == engine.last_market_slot`).
Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo build-sbf --no-default-features
cargo test --release --test test_security \
  test_attack_same_slot_target_lag_crank_does_not_recover_resolve \
  -- --nocapture
```

**Attacker/UX model:** a healthy exposed market receives a fresh external target
outside the per-slot cap. The first crank advances the effective index one
bounded step and leaves raw/effective target lag. A duplicate keeper crank in
the same slot is normal operational traffic and should be harmless.

**Original issue:** the wrapper passed the pending raw target to the engine's
permissionless P-last recovery dispatcher even when `dt == 0`. In the pinned
engine, `BelowProgressFloor` can validate from
`bounded_price_step_cap_abs(now_slot) == 0`; with same-slot target lag that is
true only because no additional slot elapsed, not because the market is
unrecoverable. The second crank could therefore terminal-resolve a solvent live
market at `P_last`.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
KeeperCrank recovery evidence:
  if crank_slot > last_market_slot:
    raw target may be supplied to engine recovery gates;
  if crank_slot == last_market_slot:
    ordinary crank/touch progress remains allowed;
    raw-target P-last recovery evidence is withheld.
```

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. Same-slot duplicate cranks no longer
prove below-floor recovery, while positive-dt recovery remains available.

## F8 — Hybrid duplicate-oracle staircase must keep mark on index (Medium)

**Status:** fixed by having hybrid regular-hours mark state track every
accepted effective external-oracle step, not just fresh publish-time advances.
Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo build-sbf --no-default-features
cargo test --release --test test_tradecpi \
  test_external_hybrid_duplicate_oracle_staircase_keeps_mark_on_external_index \
  -- --nocapture
cargo test --release --test test_tradecpi external_hybrid -- --nocapture
```

**Attacker/UX model:** a live-OI hybrid market receives a fresh external target
that is outside the per-slot cap. The first fresh read starts the clamped
target/effective staircase. Later cranks may reuse the same publish-time update
while it remains within `max_staleness_secs`; those duplicate reads are not new
liveness proofs, but they are legitimate continuation steps toward the already
accepted target.

**Original issue:** the hybrid mark cache (`mark_ewma_e6` / `ewma_mark_e6`)
reset only when the external oracle publish time advanced. During later duplicate
staircase steps, `last_effective_price_e6` moved while the mark stayed at the
previous effective price. That created regular-hours mark/index divergence and
therefore surprising funding/fee behavior before after-hours fallback had
started.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
Hybrid regular-hours external branch:
  fresh publish_time advances last_good_oracle_slot and sets target;
  duplicate publish_time never advances last_good_oracle_slot;
  any accepted effective staircase movement updates mark_ewma_e6 and
  ewma_mark_e6 to the same effective price.

Hybrid after-hours fallback branch:
  unchanged from F5/F7; trade flow owns EWMA and pays dynamic externality fees.
```

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. Regular-hours hybrid is now fully
oracle/index-owned across both fresh and duplicate staircase steps, while the
hard-stale liveness cursor remains protected from replay.

## F7 — Hybrid regular-hours duplicate oracle must not become trade-owned mark (Medium)

**Status:** fixed locally by making hybrid trade-derived mark updates and dynamic
mark fees active only in the stale-oracle fallback branch. Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo build-sbf --no-default-features
cargo test --release --test test_tradecpi \
  test_external_hybrid_fresh_duplicate_oracle_uses_external_mark_not_trade_mark \
  -- --nocapture
cargo test --release --test test_tradecpi external_hybrid -- --nocapture
```

**Attacker model:** a trader controls both signed bilateral accounts or a
matcher quote, and can submit a still-fresh but duplicate Pyth Pull update
inside the regular-hours staleness window. The market is configured for hybrid
after-hours mode, so the external oracle should own the mark while it is fresh,
and trade flow should own the EWMA only after soft-stale fallback starts.

**Original issue:** if the Pyth account's publish time was unchanged but still
inside `max_staleness_secs`, `read_price_and_stamp` accepted the external
baseline without advancing `last_good_oracle_slot`. A wide `TradeNoCpi` or
matcher fill in a later slot could then move `mark_ewma_e6` and pay a dynamic
mark fee even though the market had not entered after-hours fallback.

**Fix invariant:**

```text
Hybrid fresh/duplicate oracle branch:
  mark_ewma_e6 remains pinned to the accepted external baseline;
  mark_ewma_last_slot is not refreshed by trade flow;
  trade fee is the configured base fee.

Hybrid soft-stale fallback branch:
  consenting arbitrary-price trades remain live;
  trade flow may move EWMA subject to clamp + fee weighting;
  fee includes the stale-fallback uncertainty floor.
```

**Disposition:** `PASS_SAFE` after fix. The hybrid branch now has a clean
regular-hours/after-hours split: regular hours are oracle-owned, after hours are
trade-owned with dynamic externality fees.

## F5 — Hybrid stale-fallback trade must pay the next-step uncertainty floor (High)

**Status:** fixed locally by keeping the flexible trade path and charging a stale-fallback uncertainty floor. Regression coverage:

```bash
cargo test --release --test test_tradecpi \
  test_attack_external_hybrid_market_hours_stale_account_fallback_cannot_extract_lp_value \
  test_attack_external_hybrid_tradenocpi_stale_fallback_cannot_extract_lp_value \
  -- --nocapture
```

**Attacker model:** a trader controls their signed trade, matcher/tail account choice, and the Pyth Pull update account supplied to the wrapper. A fresh regular-hours Pyth update can exist elsewhere, while the supplied account is stale and the market-owned `last_good_oracle_slot` has crossed the hybrid soft-stale window.

**Original exploit:** the attacker opened at the stale EWMA fallback mark, then a valid crank installed the fresh external price one slot later inside the configured clamp. With only the static base fee, the user's extractable claim increased against the LP/counterparty.

**Fix invariant:** hybrid fallback does not reject consenting arbitrary-price trades. Instead, while the wrapper is using stale EWMA fallback, the trade fee must cover:

```text
trade_fee_base_bps + max(actual EWMA mark move bps, max_price_move_bps_per_slot)
```

That charges for the next honest external-oracle step even when the trade executes at the unchanged fallback mark and the EWMA does not move. Both `TradeCpi` and `TradeNoCpi` now assert the fee floor and the post-crank claim bound.

**Follow-up scan:** the same stale-fallback exploit was re-run as a direction/API matrix:

- `TradeCpi`, user long, honest oracle moves one configured step up.
- `TradeCpi`, user short, honest oracle moves one configured step down.
- `TradeNoCpi`, user long, honest oracle moves one configured step up.
- `TradeNoCpi`, user short, honest oracle moves one configured step down.

Regression: `test_attack_external_hybrid_stale_fallback_direction_matrix_cannot_extract`. Each branch asserts the exact two-sided fallback fee and that the user's post-crank extractable claim does not increase. Disposition: `PASS_SAFE`.

## F6 — Weird-state liveness: position must trade, liquidate, or resolve (High)

**Status:** scanned and covered. The public invariant is:

```text
For every live open position in a non-terminal market state, either:
  (a) a consenting nonzero trade can execute under engine health rules, or
  (b) KeeperCrank can make bounded progress and eventually liquidate/touch it.

For terminal oracle states, live trades may reject, but the market must expose a
permissionless resolve/close path so the position is not stuck.
```

Covered weird states and public paths:

- External raw-target/effective-price lag: `TradeCpi` and `TradeNoCpi` still execute consenting fills. Regressions: `test_external_tradecpi_executes_while_oracle_target_lags_effective_price`, `test_external_tradenocpi_executes_while_oracle_target_lags_effective_price`, `test_target_lag_trade_executes_without_external_value_movement`.
- EwmaMark target/effective-index lag: trades still execute while the clamped index catches up. Regression: `test_ewma_mark_trades_execute_while_target_lags_effective_index`.
- Exposed market just beyond one max-dt segment: nonzero trades can advance bounded progress; zero-fill cannot be used as a hidden crank. Regressions: `test_trade_nocpi_requires_crank_for_exposed_price_progress`, `test_tradecpi_nonzero_fill_requires_crank_for_exposed_price_progress`, `test_tradecpi_zero_fill_rejects_exposed_price_progress`.
- Far-behind exposed market: trades reject with `CatchupRequired`, repeated keeper cranks catch up, and trades work after catchup. Regressions: `test_trade_nocpi_far_behind_recovers_after_repeated_keeper_cranks`, `test_tradecpi_far_behind_recovers_after_repeated_keeper_cranks`.
- Liquidatable bounded-catchup state: honest candidate cranks keep committing progress and liquidate before deferred catchup can drain insurance. Regressions: `test_keeper_crank_partial_catchup_candidate_sequence_does_not_drain_insurance`, `test_crank_dense_same_side_fullclose_candidate_eventually_liquidates`.
- Dense/evicted-risk-buffer states: empty or padded cranks cannot drain insurance, and candidate-covered keeper cranks keep making progress while public inputs remain adversarial. Regressions: issue-65 tests in `test_security`.
- Haircut/stress state: direct close of unconverted positive PnL remains blocked, but new consenting liquidity can trade to clear positions and keeper/force-close paths remain available. Regressions: `test_live_haircut_conditions_block_unconverted_positive_pnl_close`, `test_haircut_new_mm_capital_protected_non_inverted`, `test_haircut_new_mm_capital_protected_inverted`.
- Hybrid soft-stale after-hours state: trades remain live through EWMA fallback and pay dynamic/fallback uncertainty fees. Regressions: F5 tests above plus same-mark and band-edge hybrid tests.
- Hybrid hard-stale terminal state: live trades reject, permissionless resolve succeeds, and existing open positions can be owner-closed after resolution. Regression: `test_external_hybrid_hard_stale_blocks_trading_and_allows_permissionless_resolve`.

Verification commands from this scan:

```bash
cargo test --release --test test_tradecpi
cargo test --release --test test_basic
cargo test --release --test test_security issue65 -- --nocapture
cargo test --release --test test_economic_attack_vectors
```

Disposition: `PASS_SAFE`. No state was found where an open position is both non-liquidatable by valid keeper progress and unable to trade/resolve/close through a public path.

# Security findings — 2026-04-22 deep sweep

Whitehat deep-dive after the `d19a712` fixes landed. All four findings

# Security R&D loop for Claude (perp DEX, DPRK-style adversarial mode)

This is the idealized methodology for future sessions. Follow it
verbatim. The loop runs until a budget is exhausted or a STOP
condition fires. Output of every iteration is a disposition.

## Mindset

Assume the code is wrong. Assume every comment is a lie. Assume every
invariant asserted in docs has a contradicting path somewhere in the
code. Your job is to find the path, not to confirm the doc. If you
find yourself thinking "this is probably fine," stop and write the
test.

Economic-exploit lens: "safe" means the adversary cannot leave the
transaction richer than they entered it, and cannot deny others that
same property. Anything else — weird state, spec violations, undefined
behavior — is a potential exploit primitive even if no single test
proves the drain.

## The loop

For each iteration:

1. **Pick a target.** Use the selection criteria below. Prefer areas
   not already in the *Verified Secure Areas* list in
   `memory/MEMORY.md`. Record the choice.

2. **State the attacker model.** One paragraph, concrete:
   - What does the attacker control (accounts, signatures, tx
     ordering, tail accounts for matcher CPI)?
   - What does the attacker own or have access to (capital, fresh
     oracle observation, matcher program, slab admin keys)?
   - What is the protocol invariant they intend to break (vault
     conservation, haircut correctness, fee anti-retroactivity,
     oracle monotonicity, risk-buffer consistency, etc.)?
   - What is the observable success criterion (`cap_delta > 0 with
     no position`, `insurance_delta < 0 with no admin action`,
     `vault - c_tot - insurance - net_pnl > 0`, etc.)?

3. **Write one LiteSVM integration test.** Rules:
   - Use `TestEnv` / existing helpers. No custom scaffolding.
   - Exercise full transaction flow against the production BPF
     binary (`env.svm.send_transaction`). Unit-tested internals
     are out of scope — this loop is for end-to-end adversarial
     behavior.
   - The test name encodes the attack: `test_attack_<thing>_
     <mechanism>_<expected_or_weird>`. If it passes, the name
     will read as a negative result ("…_rejected"); if it fails,
     as a positive finding ("…_leaks_insurance").
   - Assert the success criterion directly. No "just doesn't
     panic" assertions — DPRK attackers are happy to pass a test
     that returned inconsistent state.

4. **Run.** `cargo test --release --test <file> <name>`. Read the
   actual output — not the exit code alone. Weird logs (unexpected
   errors, panics in CI-only paths, CU anomalies) are findings even
   when the test "passes."

   **Weirdness signals that matter even on a green test:**
   - Transaction succeeded but the error message path was reachable
     (e.g. `Custom(19)` where you expected `Custom(0x12)`) — the
     code rejected for the wrong reason, meaning the intended check
     is not the one that actually fired.
   - CU consumption outside the usual envelope (±30%) on a path
     you thought was small. Implies unexpected work or a loop you
     didn't model.
   - State moved in a field you didn't assert. Always re-read
     `num_used_accounts`, `c_tot`, `insurance`, `vault`, and the
     touched account's `pnl` + `fee_credits` + `reserved_pnl` — not
     just the one field you were probing. Partial movement
     elsewhere is a finding even if the probed field matches.
   - Success where failure was expected. Write the negative case
     (`expect_err`) just as carefully as the positive case —
     otherwise an accidentally-removed guard silently passes.
   - Off-by-one vs clean rounding. If you expect exactly `X` and
     get `X-1`, ask WHY the rounding went that direction. Floor
     vs ceil chosen differently on credit vs debit paths is an
     attack pattern (see library: `rounding asymmetry`).

5. **Probe fired? Investigate BEFORE writing up.** When a test
   assertion fails or observable state looks weird:

   a. **Understanding check first.** Ask: is my invariant too
      narrow? The spec frequently distinguishes which fields move
      on which paths (e.g. this protocol's §6.1 losses realize
      immediately to `capital`, §6.2 profits park in `pnl` for
      warmup). A capital-only conservation check on a trade will
      fire even when the code is correct. **Widen the invariant
      to include every field the spec says moves, then re-run.**
      Only claim a finding after the widened invariant still breaks.

   a.5. **Test-setup check.** Verify the account(s) you're probing
      are in the intended state RIGHT BEFORE the tx you're
      probing — not just after your initial `set_account`. Helper
      functions (`set_slot`, `set_slot_and_price`, `crank`,
      `top_up_insurance`, ...) may silently overwrite or reset
      accounts you touched earlier. The pattern:

      ```rust
      // your override
      env.svm.set_account(env.some_account, Account { ... });
      // ... some intermediate helper calls ...
      env.set_slot(500);           // may reset env.some_account!
      env.svm.expire_blockhash();

      // VERIFY right before the probe:
      let right_before = env.svm.get_account(&env.some_account).unwrap();
      println!("{:?}", &right_before.data[OFFSET..]);
      // Then send the probe tx.
      ```

      Without this check, a "finding" that's really a helper-
      induced revert looks identical to an exploit. One wasted
      iteration per false positive minimum.

   a.6. **Equivalent-path check.** Before claiming a "dangerous
      privilege is forwarded through path X" finding, ask: *can
      an attacker achieve the same outcome via a simpler path?*
      The tx-level signer set is already the full attack surface
      a malicious frontend has. A CPI that forwards signer flags
      to a subprogram only ADDS attack surface if that subprogram
      can do something the attacker couldn't do with a separate
      top-level instruction in the same tx.

      Example: "wrapper forwards user signer to matcher CPI →
      malicious matcher drains user's ATA via spl_token::transfer."
      This is NOT a finding, because a malicious frontend can
      achieve the same drain by appending a plain
      spl_token::transfer instruction to the tx — no matcher CPI
      required. The forwarding doesn't expand attack surface
      beyond "user signed a malicious tx."

      General form: X is a finding only if the attacker's
      capability after X > their capability without X. If
      capability is identical, X is design/documentation, not
      exploit.

   b. **Reproduce with a minimal setup.** Strip the scenario to
      the smallest that still surfaces the weirdness. Fewer moving
      pieces = clearer attribution.

   c. **Diff against the stated invariant.** Quote the spec line
      or code comment that the weirdness contradicts. If no such
      line exists, the weirdness may be undocumented-but-intended
      behavior — ask the user rather than assume.

   d. **Only then decide disposition.** If after (a)-(c) the
      weirdness persists AND contradicts a stated invariant, go to
      PASS_WEIRD or EXPLOIT. If it resolves to "my model was
      wrong," keep the widened test as regression (it's now a
      guard against anyone re-breaking the real invariant) and
      move on. Do NOT file a finding based on an unwidened probe.

6. **Disposition.** After step 5's investigate-first pass, exactly one of:

   - **PASS_SAFE** — protocol behaved correctly under attack. If the
     test exercises a genuinely under-tested path, keep it as
     regression coverage and add a one-line `// regression: <attack>`
     comment. Otherwise **delete the test** (don't let passing
     adversarial probes accumulate as noise). Record the attempt in
     session notes but do NOT add to `scripts/security.md`.

   - **PASS_WEIRD** — protocol reverted, but with a wrong error code,
     leaked state via logs, consumed anomalous CU, or returned
     inconsistent-looking state that the test's success criterion
     doesn't catch. Write a `Fn — <title> (severity, conditional?)`
     entry in `scripts/security.md` citing the exact file:line and
     observable quirk. Keep the test. Do NOT claim exploit until
     you've chained the weirdness into an actual economic success
     criterion — then promote to **EXPLOIT**.

   - **EXPLOIT** — the attacker's success criterion was met. STOP
     the loop. Write the finding in `scripts/security.md` with:
     1. Exact file:line of the broken check.
     2. Reproduction steps (commit SHA + `cargo test` incantation).
     3. Economic quantification (how much per attack, how often
        repeatable, what fraction of TVL at risk).
     4. Root-cause analysis from first principles (no "add a
        check here" band-aids until RCA is written).
     5. Proposed fix.
     Keep the test. Do not loop further until the exploit is
     closed and the test is passing (i.e., attack rejected).

7. **If fixed:** verify the fixed test now asserts the SAFE outcome
   (failure of the attack), re-run ALL tiers (default, small,
   medium), commit, push. Only then resume the loop.

## Target selection criteria

Rank candidates by adversarial signal, pick the top-ranked un-audited
one each iteration:

| Signal | Weight | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-instruction state machine (e.g. init → catchup → trade → withdraw) | HIGH | Cross-instruction timing windows, stale state |
| Admin-changeable config that affects math (funding cap, unit_scale, mark_min_fee) | HIGH | Retroactivity, rate-change racing |
| Wide-math (U256/U512) operations near boundary values | HIGH | Overflow, rounding exploits |
| Self-referential dispatch (matcher CPI, LP PDA derivation) | HIGH | Identity spoofing, CPI reentrancy |
| Frozen-time modes (resolved, stale-matured) | MED | Post-freeze writes, zombie state |
| Permissionless paths callable by anyone (crank, catchup, reclaim) | MED | DoS + grief vectors |
| Oracle-free paths (ewma_mark, dead-oracle) | MED | Mark manipulation, liveness spoofing |
| Aggregate counters (c_tot, pnl_pos_tot, oi_eff_*) updated across many paths | MED | Drift between aggregate and sum-of-accounts |
| Bitmap/cursor state (fee sweep cursor, risk buffer scan cursor) | LOW | Consistency under partial progress |
| Pure functions (no state) | LOW | Already well-covered by Kani |

De-prioritize targets already listed under *Verified Secure Areas* in
`memory/MEMORY.md`. Re-audit only if the code has changed since the
verification date.

## Perp DEX failure-modes checklist (49 categories)

Curated from historical perp DEX incidents. Iterate through these
when nothing else jumps out. Each entry names the failure and the
observable symptom.

### Liquidation failures
1. **Under-liquidation** — position deserves liq but doesn't trigger (oracle lag, MM check off-by-one).
2. **Over-liquidation** — liq fires on healthy position (bad clamp, stale oracle).
3. **Liquidation fee leak** — fee > user's remaining capital, uncovered debt.
4. **Liquidation at wrong price** — oracle vs mark divergence exploited.
5. **Partial-liq dust cascade** — tiny residual position re-liquidates every slot.
6. **Keeper grief / non-crank** — keeper withholds crank for profit timing.
7. **Self-liquidation profit** — same owner profits from liquidating themselves.
8. **Liquidation arbitrage via ADL** — liquidator pre-positions opposite side.

### Funding failures
9. **Funding rate manipulation via mark** — pay fees to push mark.
10. **Funding snapshot race** — rate captured at wrong time window.
11. **Funding retroactivity** — admin change applies to past slots.
12. **Zero-OI funding boundary** — one side has no OI, funding undefined.
13. **Funding overflow** — rate × dt exceeds math bounds.

### Oracle failures
14. **Oracle lag / stale read** — clamp breaker bypassed.
15. **Oracle jump / cap bypass** — extreme move not clamped.
16. **Confidence interval abuse** — wide-conf reads accepted.
17. **Feed spoofing** — wrong feed_id in Pyth account.
18. **Stale-matured race** — resolution-eligible vs fresh observation.

### Margin failures
19. **IM bypass on position flip** — flip uses MM instead of IM.
20. **MM boundary off-by-one** — `>` vs `>=`.
21. **Equity during fee accrual** — margin check on pre-fee capital.
22. **Reserved PnL in margin** — warmup buckets counted as equity.

### Ordering / MEV failures
23. **Sandwich on trades** — front-run known orders.
24. **Liquidation front-running** — push price, liquidate, revert.
25. **Fee-sync timing** — trigger sync at specific slot for gain.
26. **Cross-tx race in same block** — state mutation between txs.
27. **Crank reward farming** — keeper selective-crank for rewards.

### Admin / auth failures
28. **Authority rotation race** — burn mid-operation.
29. **Admin path leaked to non-admin** — missing require_admin.
30. **Resolved-market writes** — post-resolve mutation paths.
31. **Premarket force-close bypass** — improper force-close auth.

### Accounting failures
32. **c_tot drift from sum(capitals)** — aggregate mismatch.
33. **pnl_pos_tot drift** — same for positive PnL.
34. **OI imbalance** — oi_long ≠ oi_short.
35. **Vault / capital mismatch** — tokens appear/disappear.
36. **Fee debt → positive** — fee_credits > 0 corruption.

### Numerical failures
37. **i128::MIN negation** — abs() panics.
38. **Wide math overflow** — u256/u512 mul exceeds.
39. **Division by zero** — ratio denominator zero.
40. **Rounding asymmetry** — floor/ceil on credit vs debit.

### Warmup / ADL failures
41. **Warmup bucket timing** — sched→pending→released transitions.
42. **ADL epoch mismatch state** — stale account position count.
43. **Full-drain reset race** — reset during inflight trade.
44. **Haircut precision** — rounding gain/loss asymmetry.

### Init / lifecycle failures
45. **Double init** — re-init corrupts state.
46. **Init with extreme params** — config breaks invariants.
47. **Close with residual** — sched/pending not cleared.
48. **Reclaim on non-flat** — reclaim fires when shouldn't.
49. **LP identity reuse** — same lp_account_id for different instances.

## Attack pattern library (seed for hypothesis generation)

Use these as prompts when nothing obvious jumps out. Each is worth at
least one iteration.

- **Retroactive rate change**: admin changes a rate, next call
  charges OLD slots at NEW rate. (Applies to funding, maintenance
  fee, cap — but maintenance fee is init-immutable in this codebase,
  verified.)
- **Double-accounting via alternate entry points**: same mutation
  reachable via instruction A and instruction B; one path forgets a
  precondition check the other enforces.
- **Aggregate drift**: update one field directly (e.g.
  `acc.pnl = X`) without going through the setter that maintains the
  aggregate (`set_pnl`). Previously hit as Bug #10.
- **TOCTOU across CPI**: value read before matcher CPI, used after,
  assumed unchanged — but matcher could have reentered or a co-signer
  could have mutated.
- **Partial-progress leak**: a multi-step operation that persists
  intermediate state (e.g. sweep cursor, catchup chunk progress).
  Abort mid-way → resume → state is inconsistent with the original
  caller's assumption.
- **Sentinel re-materialization**: an identifier that's "never seen"
  (generation=0, lp_account_id=0, entry_price=0) gets reused after
  reclaim → old check-against-sentinel logic misfires.
- **Dust sweep capture**: vault accumulates orphaned dust (from
  rounding, misaligned deposits, set_capital bypasses), then the
  empty-market sweep captures it into insurance. Attacker deposits
  dust on purpose and triggers the sweep.
- **Frozen-time write**: resolved or stale-matured markets should be
  read-only. Any write path that forgets the gate is a finding.
- **Idempotency gap**: two calls at the same anchor should equal one
  call at that anchor. If the second call has side effects (advances
  cursor, stamps liveness, triggers reward), it's an amplifier.
- **Zeno admission**: a cap/cooldown/gate that's expressed as a bps
  or fraction. Around small values, `x * bps / 10_000 == 0` →
  operation is silently skipped or misbehaves. Fund can't drain, a
  key never rotates, etc.
- **Rounding asymmetry**: floor vs ceiling chosen differently on
  credit vs debit paths. Attacker arbitrages the rounding.
- **Bitmap-cursor replay**: cursor wraps around MAX_ACCOUNTS, revisits
  a freshly-reclaimed slot, applies stale state.
- **Signed-integer overflow at boundary**: `i128::MIN` negation, sign
  flip on max position, `checked_neg` assumption.
- **Matcher-returned zero**: exec_size=0 with FLAG_VALID set, exec_price=0,
  req_id=0 echoed. Each is a potential parser corner.
- **Panic-reachable-from-instruction**: if any `unwrap()`, `panic!()`,
  `unreachable!()` is reachable with attacker-controlled inputs,
  that's a DoS.

## Outcome disposition rules

1. **Never commit a test without understanding what it proves.** If
   the test passes for reasons you don't fully explain, that is a
   finding in itself — it means you don't understand the code well
   enough to trust your adversarial model.

2. **Delete aggressively.** A failed attack that doesn't add coverage
   is clutter. The test suite's job is to catch regressions, not
   document every attack you considered.

3. **One finding per test.** If a test surfaces two issues, split.

4. **A fix is not "add a check here".** Every fix starts with "the
   root cause is …" in prose, then the code. If you can't state the
   root cause, you don't have a fix, you have a symptom suppressor.

5. **Re-run ALL tiers** (default 4096, small 256, medium 1024) after
   any code change. A fix that only passes at default size is not a
   fix — it's a coincidence.

## Stop conditions

Halt the loop and report when any of these fire:
- EXPLOIT disposition (fix before continuing).
- Discovery that an entire area listed in *Verified Secure* is
  actually not (prior audit was wrong → re-audit required, new pass).
- Two consecutive PASS_SAFE iterations on different targets — the
  easy-to-find attacks are out, the expected-value of the next
  iteration is low, hand back to the user for target guidance.
- User-defined budget (time, CU, iterations).

## Where to write

- Findings: `scripts/security.md` (append to existing F-series).
- Long-form analysis / per-session journal: `research/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  (gitignored).
- Tests: `tests/test_basic.rs` (small / protocol-level) or
  `tests/test_security.rs` (explicit attack tests). Put adversarial
  tests in `test_security.rs` when they're >20 lines — keeps the
  mental model clear.
- Cross-reference: every finding in security.md cites a specific
  `tests/<file>::<fn>` that reproduces or regresses it.

## F1 — CatchupAccrue partial mode rolls back `last_oracle_publish_time` (HIGH, conditional)

**Location:** `src/percolator.rs:8385-8387` (partial-catchup branch of
`Instruction::CatchupAccrue`).

**Code:**
```rust
let mut restored = config_pre;
restored.last_good_oracle_slot = config.last_good_oracle_slot;
state::write_config(&mut data, &restored);
```

**Bug.** The partial branch rolls back `config` to its pre-read value
(`config_pre`) but preserves only `last_good_oracle_slot`. It does NOT
preserve `last_oracle_publish_time`.

After commit `168cc0b`, `clamp_external_price` enforces:
`publish_time > last_oracle_publish_time` for advance. The test
invariant "a single Pyth observation refreshes liveness at most once"
holds in the normal path.

In partial catchup:
1. `read_price_and_stamp` called with publish_time = T. Config sees
   `last_oracle_publish_time → T`, `last_good_oracle_slot → clock.slot`.
2. Engine catches up partially (can't finish because funding-active
   and `gap > max_step_per_call`).
3. Selective rollback: `last_good_oracle_slot` preserved (stamp
   survives), but `last_oracle_publish_time` rolls back to its
   pre-read value.
4. **Next** CatchupAccrue call, same Pyth account: publish_time = T
   is still `> config.last_oracle_publish_time` (rolled back) →
   passes the "fresh observation" gate → advances
   `last_good_oracle_slot` AGAIN.

Invariant break: one observation can refresh liveness multiple times
across partial catchups. An attacker holding a single fresh Pyth
account can keep issuing partial catchups to stamp liveness on every
call, even without ever presenting a genuinely newer observation.

**Severity conditional.** Under the init constraint that
`permissionless_resolve_stale_slots <= max_accrual_dt_slots`, partial
catchup in a perm-resolve market should be hard to reach before
stale maturity — the gap that forces PARTIAL also forces stale
maturity. But the code-level invariant is broken and the fix is
trivial.

**Fix.** Preserve the timestamp atomically with the liveness stamp:
```rust
let mut restored = config_pre;
restored.last_good_oracle_slot = config.last_good_oracle_slot;
restored.last_oracle_publish_time = config.last_oracle_publish_time;
state::write_config(&mut data, &restored);
```

## F2 — EwmaMark liveness spoofable via cheap self-trades when `mark_min_fee == 0` (HIGH)

**Location:** `src/percolator.rs:6205-6209` (TradeCpi EwmaMark branch).

**Code:**
```rust
let full_weight = config.mark_min_fee == 0
    || fee_paid_ewma_mark >= config.mark_min_fee;
if full_weight {
    config.last_mark_push_slot = clock.slot as u128;
}
```

**Bug.** When `mark_min_fee == 0`, the short-circuit OR makes every
successful EwmaMark trade "full-weight" — advances
`last_mark_push_slot`, which is the ONLY hard-timeout liveness
signal for EwmaMark (see `permissionless_stale_matured`).

Default EwmaMark init (`encode_init_market_ewma_mark` → `encode_init_market_full_v2`)
sets `mark_min_fee = 0`. A permissionless attacker with their own
LP + matcher can round-trip tiny self-trades (even `trading_fee_bps=0`
markets work) to refresh `last_mark_push_slot` every slot, blocking
`permissionless_stale_matured` from ever tripping.

**Impact.** `ResolvePermissionless` is the terminal exit for users
after admin burns the mark authority. Attacker-blocked resolve =
users stuck in a zombie market.

**Severity HIGH** because:
- Permissionless attack (any user can deploy their own matcher).
- Real bricking vector, not dust accumulation.
- Default config ships with the hole open.

**Fix.** Require a nonzero `mark_min_fee` at InitMarket when the
market is EwmaMark AND `permissionless_resolve_stale_slots > 0`. This
is the config-time gate — simpler than decoupling the trade path,
operator-visible, doesn't change the EWMA/trade semantics honest
users rely on. EwmaMark markets without perm-resolve (admin-resolve
only) can keep `mark_min_fee = 0` since there's no bricking vector.

## F3 — Account-slot exhaustion when `new_account_fee == 0 AND maintenance_fee_per_slot == 0` (documented config-risk, NOT enforced)

**Location:** `src/percolator.rs:4660-4672` (InitUser),
`src/percolator.rs:4774-4785` (InitLP).

**Bug.** Wrapper InitUser/InitLP only require `capital_units > 0`.
With `new_account_fee = 0`, a 1-base-unit deposit materializes a
permanent account slot. Attacker fills `max_accounts` slots for
near-zero cost.

The dust-reclaim fix in commit `b5ddaeb` mitigates this IF
`maintenance_fee_per_slot > 0` (accounts drain → reclaim in the fee
sweep). But with BOTH `new_account_fee = 0` AND
`maintenance_fee_per_slot = 0`, no drain mechanism exists → slots
stay filled indefinitely.

**Decision: documentation-only, not enforced.** Trusted-admin /
KYC'd / demo / test deployments may legitimately want neither gate
on (e.g., admin reviews account creations out-of-band, or the
market is short-lived test infrastructure). Enforcing the
"must-pick-one" rule at init was tried — it broke 84 existing
tests that use both-zero for legitimate test simplicity. Operator
policy instead:

- **Permissionless production markets MUST set at least one gate**
  (`new_account_fee > 0` or `maintenance_fee_per_slot > 0`).
- Otherwise an attacker fills `max_accounts` with 1-unit dust and
  bricks onboarding.

A comment pointing at this doc is placed at the InitMarket validation
site.

## F4 — `ForceCloseResolved` payout accepts any owner token account, not the canonical ATA (LOW, doc drift)

**Location:** `src/percolator.rs:7746` (code);
`src/percolator.rs:1402` (stale doc).

**Code:**
```rust
verify_token_account(a_owner_ata, &owner_pubkey, &mint)?;
```

**Bug.** The doc comment at `src/percolator.rs:1402` says "Sends
capital to stored owner ATA." In reality, `verify_token_account`
only checks (a) the account is a valid SPL token account, (b) its
token-owner field equals the stored owner pubkey, (c) its mint
matches. It does NOT derive the canonical Associated Token Address
and compare.

**Impact.** Admin-only op (gated by `require_admin`). An admin can
route payouts to any token account owned by the victim — not just the
ATA. Not a theft vector (the victim owns it), but:
- Payout goes to a non-canonical account the victim may not expect
  or monitor.
- Violates the documented contract.

**Severity LOW.** Low-privilege attacker doesn't have this capability;
admin is already trusted. Documentation/contract-drift issue.

**Fix.** Update the doc to match reality. The flexibility is
operationally useful (victim's canonical ATA might be closed or
broken); the doc is the right place to restore truth.

---

## Confirmed closed from prior review

All the previously-raised oracle-path issues, re-checked against
`d19a712`, are closed in the normal path:

- **Same-publish_time replay** — `clamp_external_price` requires
  `publish_time > last` (strict `<=` short-circuit). Cap-walk
  attempts return the stored baseline.
- **`last_good_oracle_slot` stamped on stale reads** —
  `read_price_and_stamp` snapshots `last_oracle_publish_time` before
  the call and only stamps the liveness cursor when it advanced.
- **Zero-fill TradeCpi ratchet** — rollback preserves
  `last_oracle_publish_time` atomically with `last_effective_price_e6`.
- **`new_account_fee` scale alignment** — InitMarket rejects
  misaligned fee so the InitUser/InitLP split can't create
  unavoidable dust.
- **Dust account slot reclamation** — wrapper's
  `sweep_maintenance_fees` reclaims flat zero-capital accounts in
  the same pass, so crank-only reclamation works when fees are
  enabled.
- **EwmaMark EWMA clock on sub-threshold trades** — both TradeCpi
  and TradeNoCpi now gate clock bump on full-weight observation.

That leaves F1–F4 as new findings from this pass. F1/F2/F3 are
actionable fixes; F4 is a doc correction.

## Fix order (TDD)

Each fix lands with a failing regression test first, then the fix,
then test passes, one commit per finding.

1. **F1**: preserve `last_oracle_publish_time` in the partial
   CatchupAccrue rollback. Test: two successive partial-catchup
   calls with the same Pyth account → `last_good_oracle_slot`
   advances only once.
2. **F2**: reject EwmaMark init when
   `permissionless_resolve_stale_slots > 0 AND mark_min_fee == 0`.
   Test: init with that combo → rejection.
3. **F3**: reject InitMarket when `new_account_fee == 0 AND
   maintenance_fee_per_slot == 0`. Test: init with both zero →
   rejection.
4. **F4**: update the `ForceCloseResolved` doc to match reality.

---

## Additional surfaces traced in this sweep (no new findings)

To justify stopping the sweep at F1–F4, these high-value surfaces
were also traced and confirmed safe at `1795eba`:

### TradeCpi adversarial matcher

The matcher program is an arbitrary caller-chosen CPI target. In
principle it could try to mutate state mid-instruction.
Defense-in-depth is solid:

- **Solana ownership rule**: the slab is owned by percolator; a
  matcher (different program) cannot write to the slab's data
  buffer directly, regardless of whether the slab is passed as
  writable in the outer tx.
- **Reentrancy guard**: `set_cpi_in_progress` is set before the
  CPI at `src/percolator.rs:5952-5955`; every instruction handler
  calls `slab_guard` which rejects if the flag is set
  (`src/percolator.rs:3746-3748`). A matcher trying to re-enter
  percolator from inside the CPI fails immediately.
- **LP PDA validation**: `find_program_address` against
  `["lp", slab_key, lp_idx]` — PDA key match implies only
  percolator can sign for it, so it's always system-owned with
  zero data. Can't be spoofed.
- **Matcher identity binding**: `matcher_program` and
  `matcher_context` are stored at InitLP and checked against the
  CPI args. Can't swap matcher mid-flight.
- **ABI echo**: the matcher must echo `req_id`, `lp_account_id`,
  and `oracle_price_e6` back — forgery requires the matcher to
  guess the caller's pre-CPI-computed values, which are fresh
  per-call (`req_nonce`).

### Funding rate boundary arithmetic

`compute_current_funding_rate_e9` at `src/percolator.rs:3628-3652`
was traced numerically. All intermediate products fit i128 easily
given the configured bounds:

- `diff.saturating_mul(1e9)` at worst `1.8e19 * 1e9 = 1.8e28` (fits
  i128 = ~1.7e38).
- `premium_e9 * funding_k_bps` post-clamp bounded at ~9.2e28.
- Final `.clamp(-max_rate_e9, max_rate_e9)` — `max_rate_e9 ≥ 0`
  enforced at InitMarket (`src/percolator.rs:4325-4338`) and
  UpdateConfig (`src/percolator.rs:6797-6803`), so the clamp
  invariant `min ≤ max` holds and `.clamp()` never panics.
- Engine envelope (`max_abs_funding_e9_per_slot *
  max_accrual_dt_slots`) is validated at InitMarket per
  `validate_params` in the engine crate.

### `is_resolved()` coverage across instructions

Every instruction handler was checked for post-resolution gating.
Coverage map:

- **Blocks post-resolution**: `InitUser`, `InitLP`,
  `DepositCollateral`, `WithdrawCollateral`, `KeeperCrank`,
  `TradeNoCpi`, `TradeCpi`, `TopUpInsurance`,
  `UpdateConfig`, `PushEwmaMark`,
  `ResolveMarket` (re-resolve), `WithdrawInsuranceLimited`,
  `DepositFeeCredits`,
  `ConvertReleasedPnl`, `ResolvePermissionless` (re-resolve),
  `CatchupAccrue` (confirmed at `src/percolator.rs:8314`).
- **Retired public tags**: `LiquidateAtOracle`, `ReclaimEmptyAccount`,
  and `SettleAccount` reject at decode. Their work is routed through
  `KeeperCrank` candidates/touch-only candidates.
- **Requires resolved**: `WithdrawInsurance`,
  `AdminForceCloseAccount`, `ForceCloseResolved`.
- **Mode-aware**: `CloseAccount` (both modes, different paths).
- **No explicit check (correct)**: `UpdateAuthority` — rotating
  insurance_authority post-resolution is a legitimate operational
  pattern; admin-burn has its own kind-specific invariant check.
- **No explicit check (correct)**: `CloseSlab` — requires all
  accounts freed + vault zero, which is only achievable in
  Resolved mode anyway.

### Vault / token account hygiene

- `verify_vault_empty` at `src/percolator.rs:3816-3849` enforces
  mint + owner + initialized + no delegate + no close_authority +
  zero balance. Can't smuggle pre-loaded vault at init.
- `verify_vault` at `src/percolator.rs:3777+` mirrors the checks
  for live-market validation.
- `verify_token_account` checks owner + mint only (doesn't derive
  ATA) — documented as F4.

### Crank reward economics

`CRANK_REWARD_BPS = 5000` (50% of swept fees). Traced possible
farming attacks:

- Self-cranker receives up to 50% of all swept fees in a single
  crank. Comes from insurance (zero-sum: insurance pays out what
  it just collected).
- Attacker filling dust accounts to farm rewards: nets a LOSS
  because they paid 100% of the dust capital (which becomes the
  fee source) but only recoup 50%. Economically unfavorable.
- Reward is capped at post-crank insurance balance, so drain is
  bounded. Conservation invariant (vault ≥ c_tot + insurance +
  net_pnl) is explicitly preserved with `checked_add`.

### Generation counter wrap

`next_mat_counter` at `src/percolator.rs:2246-2251` uses
`checked_add` — u64 overflow returns None → error propagates. At
~226 billion years to overflow at 1 init/slot, not a real concern
even ignoring the overflow check.

---

## Second pass — 2026-04-22 late (post F1-F4 commit)

Revisiting surfaces after F1/F2/F4 landed, plus an explicit
small/medium tier test run (655/655 each). No new actionable
findings. Surfaces traced:

### Matcher ABI return validation

`matcher_abi::validate_matcher_return` at
`src/percolator.rs:1084-1150` is thorough:

- Echoes (`req_id`, `lp_account_id`, `oracle_price_e6`) must match
  the wrapper's pre-CPI values. Any forgery rejects.
- `abi_version == MATCHER_ABI_VERSION` — prevents future matchers
  with new flag semantics being silently accepted.
- Flag bits outside `{VALID, PARTIAL_OK, REJECTED}` rejected.
- `VALID` required, `REJECTED` forbidden.
- `reserved == 0` required.
- `exec_price_e6 != 0` required (disambiguates "all zeros + valid flag").
- `exec_size == 0` requires `PARTIAL_OK`.
- `|exec_size| <= |req_size|`.
- `sign(exec_size) == sign(req_size)` when `req_size != 0`.
- `req_size == 0` is rejected at the entry (line 5770), so the
  sign check can safely skip that case.
- `exec_size == i128::MIN` with a negative req_size would pass the
  sign/abs check, but the engine's `checked_neg()` at trade
  execution (src/percolator.rs:3684) returns None → `Overflow`.
  Safely rejected downstream.

### Matcher identity immutability

`matcher_program` and `matcher_context` on an LP account are set
only at `InitLP` (`src/percolator.rs:4837-4838`) and never mutated
elsewhere. No instruction offers to change them after registration.
A registered LP is bound to its matcher for life. The only
operator consideration is that the MATCHER PROGRAM itself may be
upgradeable — operators deploying LPs should prefer matchers with
burned upgrade_authority (out of percolator's control, documented
as operator hygiene).

### Panic surface

21 uses of `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` in the wrapper, all in fixed-
width `slice.try_into()` calls after preceding length guards. Each
was traced — no unguarded panic reachable from caller input.
Notable sites:
- `matcher_abi::read_matcher_return` at line 1059: length guard
  `ctx.len() < 64` at line 1060, each slice is a fixed subrange of
  [0, 64). Safe.
- `read_chainlink_price_e6` at line 2645/2652: length guard
  `data.len() < CL_MIN_LEN (232)` upstream, both slices are within
  [138, 232). Safe.
- Wrapper's `read_u64/u128/pubkey/bytes32` all have per-call
  `input.len() < N` guards before each `try_into().unwrap()`. Safe.

### `ensure_market_accrued_to_now` idempotency

`src/percolator.rs:3500-3513`. The helper:
1. Calls `catchup_accrue(engine, now_slot, price, rate)` — returns
   early when `now_slot <= engine.last_market_slot`, when
   `max_dt == 0`, when engine never observed a real price, or when
   funding is inactive. Safe no-op in all edge cases.
2. Calls `accrue_market_to` only if `price > 0 && now_slot >
   engine.last_market_slot`. Idempotent: a second call in the same
   slot with the same price is a no-op inside the engine (§5.4
   early return on same-slot + same-price).

So instructions that call `ensure_market_accrued_to_now` AFTER
their own internal accrue-bearing engine call (which also advances
last_market_slot) don't double-accrue.

### `cluster_restarted_since_init` false-positive analysis

`src/percolator.rs:2914-2921`. The init-time sysvar read uses
`.unwrap_or(0)` as a fallback:

```rust
init_restart_slot: LastRestartSlot::get()
    .map(|lrs| lrs.last_restart_slot)
    .unwrap_or(0),
```

Theoretical false positive: sysvar fails at init (→
`init_restart_slot = 0`), then succeeds at a later read returning
any `R > 0`. `restart_detected(0, R) = true` → market
incorrectly frozen even without a real restart happening after
init.

Unreachable in practice: `LastRestartSlot` sysvar is always
available on production Solana (SIMD-0047 landed in v1.18). The
fallback exists only to avoid panicking in test environments with
stubbed runtimes. Not a mainnet concern.

### `SetOraclePriceCap` disable path

`src/percolator.rs:7037+`. Admin can reduce `oracle_price_cap_e2bps`
to 0 only when `min_oracle_price_cap_e2bps == 0` (init-time
constraint). With cap=0, the circuit breaker is effectively off —
a fresh Pyth read that lifts the price by ≥100% is passed through
clamped-to-identity. Admin-only op; explicit operator choice. Not
a protocol bug.

### Max cap (100%) semantics

`MAX_ORACLE_PRICE_CAP_E2BPS = 1_000_000` (100% per update). At
this ceiling, `clamp_oracle_price(last=X, raw=Y, cap=MAX)` allows
`Y ∈ [0, 2X]`. Prices can approach zero (rejected downstream by
`if price == 0` checks in engine/wrapper). Effectively the same
as "no cap" — documented as operator choice.

### Negative `publish_time` handling

Pyth's `publish_time` is `i64`, nominally a unix timestamp.
Theoretical negative values (pre-1970, crafted, or i64::MIN):
- `clamp_external_price` at `src/percolator.rs:2814+`: strict
  `publish_time <= last_oracle_publish_time` gate. Any negative
  publish_time with `last = 0` (init fresh market) is ≤ 0 →
  graceful fallback, no advance. Safe.
- `read_pyth_price_e6` staleness check: `age = now - publish_time`
  with saturating sub. `publish_time = i64::MIN` → `now.sat_sub(MIN)`
  saturates at `i64::MAX` → age > max_staleness_secs → reject.
  Safe.

### Reclaim forgives fee debt: loss-to-insurance analysis

When `reclaim_empty_account_not_atomic` fires on a flat zero-
capital account with `fee_credits < 0`, the debt is forgiven
(`src/percolator.rs:5346-5348` in engine). Insurance loses the
uncollected dust (shortfall = capital-drained-before-zeroing minus
fees-already-collected).

Attacker economics: they funded the account with some capital X,
which flowed to insurance as fees. Unreclaimed debt is bounded by
one max-interval's fee charge (capped at per-sync rate * dt_max).
Net protocol loss is at most one slot's fee rate per dust account,
per reclaim cycle. Attacker's net position: -X (capital lost to
insurance), so they can't profit by forcing forgiveness.

### Tier coverage

All findings re-verified against three build tiers after the F1-F4
commits:
- default (`MAX_ACCOUNTS = 4096`): 655/655 pass.
- `--features small` (`MAX_ACCOUNTS = 256`): 655/655 pass.
- `--features medium` (`MAX_ACCOUNTS = 1024`): 655/655 pass.

The SLAB_LEN cascade (RiskParams field removals in earlier
commits) was verified against all three BPF binary sizes.

## F5 — KeeperCrank reward never pays on steady-state markets (HIGH, economic)

**Location:** `src/percolator.rs:5278-5341` (KeeperCrank handler).

**Reported from devnet:** slab `dtrNVk7otCtcmPvrARnLxi5nWoNFYQYS7b9vC1Yjnt2`
with byte-identical HEAD binary (hash matches `build-sbf` output,
confirmed after stripping program-data zero padding). Permissioned
cranks with `caller_idx ∈ {0, 1}` observe full sweep → insurance
with `caller cap Δ = −fee` (no reward credit), across multiple
cranks and multiple caller identities.

**Bug.** The reward base `sweep_delta` was captured AFTER the
candidate-sync phase:

```rust
// OLD (buggy):
for &(idx, _policy) in combined.iter() { ... sync_account_fee ... }
let ins_before = engine.insurance_fund.balance.get();  // too late
sweep_maintenance_fees(engine, ...);
let sweep_delta = engine.insurance_fund.balance.get().sub(ins_before);
```

`combined = risk_buffer ++ caller_candidates`. The risk buffer
auto-populates via Phase C of the crank's own buffer maintenance
(`src/percolator.rs:5480-5491`) on every live-position market. So
on the **second and every subsequent crank**:

1. `combined` is non-empty (holds every account with a position).
2. Candidate-sync loop charges each candidate's fee to insurance.
3. `ins_before` captured — already includes those fees.
4. `sweep_maintenance_fees` iterates the bitmap, re-visits the same
   accounts, but sync is idempotent at same-slot — no additional
   fee charged.
5. `sweep_delta = 0` → reward gate fails on `sweep_delta > 0`.

LiteSVM's existing `test_keeper_crank_reward_pays_half_of_swept_fees`
only exercised the FIRST crank against a market with no positions,
so `combined` stayed empty and the bug was invisible.

**Impact.** Keeper economics broken in production: cranker pays
their own maintenance fee with zero reward credit. Over time this
disincentivizes cranking — which is the mechanism the protocol
relies on to realize maintenance fees and prune dust.

**Fix.** Capture `ins_before` BEFORE the candidate-sync loop so
the reward base covers ALL fee collection this crank performed:

```rust
// NEW:
let ins_before = engine.insurance_fund.balance.get();
for &(idx, _policy) in combined.iter() { ... sync_account_fee ... }
sweep_maintenance_fees(engine, ...);
let sweep_delta = engine.insurance_fund.balance.get().sub(ins_before);
```

No reward-inflation vector opens up: `sync_account_fee_to_slot_not_atomic`
is idempotent at same-slot (a caller can't double-charge the same
account), duplicates in `combined` are deduped at decode
(`src/percolator.rs:5311-5315`), unused slots are skipped before
budget consumption (`src/percolator.rs:5309`), and total syncs per
instruction stay bounded by `FEE_SWEEP_BUDGET`. The reward is
still 50% of exactly what the caller helped collect.

**Regression test.**
`tests/test_basic.rs::test_keeper_crank_reward_pays_on_second_crank_with_populated_risk_buffer`
— reproduces the devnet scenario: LP + user with open positions,
first crank populates the buffer, second crank must still pay
reward. Fails on HEAD before the fix with `cap Δ = −500_000`
(matching devnet), passes after.

---

## F6 — Ignored `_not_atomic` reclaim error in sweep (MEDIUM, hardening)

**Location:** `src/percolator.rs:3609` (`sweep_maintenance_fees`).

**Pattern (before):**
```rust
let _ = engine
    .reclaim_empty_account_not_atomic(idx as u16, now_slot);
```

**Concern.** The engine header states that `_not_atomic` functions
may return `Err` after partial mutation, and callers must abort
the transaction on error. Silently swallowing the Result violates
that contract. Today the wrapper's flat-clean pre-checks make all
`Undercollateralized`/`CorruptState` engine paths unreachable, so
no exploit exists — but any future engine-side precondition would
turn this into silent state corruption.

**Fix.** Add the missing `fee_credits <= 0` pre-check (closes the
last engine-side `CorruptState` path), then propagate with `?`:

```rust
if acc.capital.is_zero()
    && acc.position_basis_q == 0
    && acc.pnl == 0
    && acc.reserved_pnl == 0
    && acc.sched_present == 0
    && acc.pending_present == 0
    && acc.fee_credits.get() <= 0
{
    engine
        .reclaim_empty_account_not_atomic(idx as u16, now_slot)
        .map_err(map_risk_error)?;
}
```

Existing dust-reclaim regression coverage
(`test_dust_account_drained_and_gc_by_crank_alone`) still passes.

---

## Third pass — 2026-04-25 current-BPF replay + loop stop

Re-ran the historical finding set after the v12.19.13 wrapper churn.
Important harness note: LiteSVM integration tests load
`target/deploy/percolator_prog.so`, not the host-compiled Rust crate.
The first oversized-tail probe falsely looked unsafe until the BPF
was rebuilt with `cargo build-sbf`; after rebuild the probe matched
current source behavior. Future security loops should rebuild SBF
before treating LiteSVM results as authoritative.

### Historical findings replayed

- **F1 CatchupAccrue partial timestamp rollback** — PASS_SAFE.
  Current partial rollback preserves `last_oracle_publish_time`,
  `oracle_target_price_e6`, and `oracle_target_publish_time` along
  with `last_good_oracle_slot`.
- **F2 EwmaMark cheap-trade liveness spoof** — PASS_SAFE. Current
  InitMarket rejects EwmaMark + permissionless resolution when
  `mark_min_fee == 0`.
- **F3 zero account-fee + zero maintenance-fee slot exhaustion** —
  PASS_SAFE under current wrapper policy. InitMarket now rejects the
  both-zero configuration.
- **F4 ForceCloseResolved canonical-ATA doc drift** — PASS_SAFE.
  The instruction doc now states that any SPL token account owned by
  the stored owner and matching the collateral mint is accepted.
- **F5 KeeperCrank reward base captured too late** — PASS_SAFE.
  Reward base is captured before candidate sync and bitmap sweep;
  second-crank reward regression passes.
- **F6 ignored `_not_atomic` reclaim error in sweep** — PASS_SAFE.
  Sweep now pre-checks `fee_credits != i128::MIN` and propagates the
  reclaim result.

### Fresh loop iterations

1. **Target:** TradeCpi variadic matcher tail.
   **Attacker model:** caller controls the outer transaction account
   list and supplies more tail accounts than the matcher ABI budget,
   aiming to force unbounded wrapper allocation/CPI forwarding or
   matcher-side state mutation before rejection.
   **Probe:** `tests/test_tradecpi.rs::
   test_attack_tradecpi_oversized_tail_rejected_before_cpi`.
   **Disposition:** PASS_SAFE. With freshly rebuilt BPF, the wrapper
   rejects oversized tails before matcher CPI; user/LP positions,
   capitals, SPL vault, engine vault, and matcher context are
   unchanged. Regression kept because it covers the protocol cap.

2. **Target:** InitLP matcher identity sentinel values.
   **Attacker model:** LP owner controls InitLP data and tries to
   register `Pubkey::default()` as matcher program or context,
   creating an unusable slot or a default-key sentinel that could
   confuse later matcher identity checks.
   **Probe:** `tests/test_tradecpi.rs::
   test_attack_init_lp_zero_matcher_identity_rejected`.
   **Disposition:** PASS_SAFE. InitLP rejects before SPL transfer or
   account materialization; `num_used_accounts`, SPL vault, and
   engine vault remain unchanged. Regression kept because it guards a
   sentinel identity invariant.

Stop condition fired after two consecutive PASS_SAFE iterations on
different targets. No new F-series finding from this pass.

## Fourth pass — 2026-04-25 raw gap-move liquidation/siphon loop

### Fresh loop iteration

1. **Target:** A1-style matched-pair insurance siphon with a raw
   oracle gap between keeper cranks.
   **Attacker model:** attacker controls both the user and LP
   keypairs and can publish a fresh external oracle observation.
   They open a near-margin matched pair, then jump the oracle from
   the no-liquidation regime toward a 25% adverse target without any
   intermediate crank, trying to make the first post-gap crank
   realize insolvency and pay LP-side profit from insurance.
   **Probe:** `tests/test_a1_siphon_regression.rs::
   test_a1_external_pyth_raw_gap_move_defended`.
   **Disposition:** PASS_SAFE. The test configures the maximum
   currently allowed non-EwmaMark stale window (`100` slots), performs
   a live `99`-slot raw no-walk gap, then resumes cranking. The
   wrapper feeds capped effective prices rather than the raw 25%
   target: attacker combined delta was `189` units on `36B`
   deposited, and insurance did not drop. Regression kept because it
   directly covers the "move between cranks" speed requirement.

No new F-series finding from this pass.

### Commands run

```text

```

Results:
- New raw gap probe: PASS.
- Full A1 siphon regression file: PASS (`4` tests).
- Full Rust/LiteSVM/CU test suite: PASS.

## Fifth pass — 2026-04-25 DEX/perp incident-pattern probes

### Fresh loop iterations

1. **Target:** dYdX/YFI-style profit recycling.
   **Attacker model:** attacker controls both sides of a matched
   trade, pushes the long into profit, repeatedly converts released
   PnL into capital, withdraws that capital while the losing short
   leg remains open, and treats every withdrawal as external wealth
   that could be redeployed into fresh accounts.
   **Probe:** `tests/test_economic_attack_vectors.rs::
   test_attack_yfi_style_profit_recycling_no_net_extraction`.
   **Disposition:** PASS_SAFE. The probe exercised the withdrawal
   leg (`9` successful withdrawals, `2.25B` withdrawn externally) and
   one explicit conversion. Combined attacker wealth
   (`withdrawn_external + user_equity + lp_equity`) stayed below the
   initial deposits, and insurance was unchanged.

2. **Target:** Mars/JELLY-style self-liquidation into the backstop.
   **Attacker model:** attacker controls a weak long and strong LP
   short, creates near-margin exposure, pushes the oracle toward a
   price that would bankrupt the long if it landed immediately, then
   relies on crank/liquidation processing to forgive the toxic leg
   while the LP keeps the gain.
   **Probe:** `tests/test_economic_attack_vectors.rs::
   test_attack_self_liquidation_backstop_no_insurance_siphon`.
   **Disposition:** PASS_SAFE. The weak leg was fully risk-reduced
   (`position 1_000_000_000 -> 0`), combined attacker wealth stayed
   below deposits, engine/SPL vaults stayed synchronized, and
   insurance increased (`5_000_000_002 -> 5_636_333_337`) rather than
   being drained.

Stop condition fired after two consecutive PASS_SAFE iterations on
different economic targets. No new F-series finding from this pass.

## Sixth pass — 2026-04-25 10x economic PASS_SAFE streak

User requested continuing until `10` consecutive `PASS_SAFE`
results. Expanded `tests/test_economic_attack_vectors.rs` to cover
10 distinct DEX/perp incident-pattern probes:

1. **dYdX/YFI-style profit recycling** — PASS_SAFE.
   Winning user converted/withdrew released PnL (`2.25B` external
   withdrawals) while losing LP leg stayed open; combined attacker
   wealth stayed below deposits, insurance unchanged.
2. **Mars/JELLY-style self-liquidation into backstop** — PASS_SAFE.
   Toxic long was flattened (`1_000_000_000 -> 0`) without net
   attacker extraction; insurance increased rather than drained.
3. **LP-side profit recycling mirror** — PASS_SAFE.
   Winning LP-side withdrawals were exercised; combined attacker
   wealth stayed below deposits and insurance increased, not drained.
4. **Target/effective-lag withdrawal** — PASS_SAFE.
   Withdrawal during raw-target/effective-price divergence rejected
   atomically; capital, position, SPL vault, and engine vault stayed
   unchanged.
5. **Target/effective-lag trade** — PASS_SAFE.
   Consenting trade during target lag executed atomically; positions
   changed, external vault balances stayed unchanged, and unsafe
   post-trade states remain subject to keeper liquidation.
6. **Whipsaw profit recycling** — PASS_SAFE.
   Attacker withdrew during an up-move, then price reversed; withdrawn
   amount remained offset by controlled-account losses.
7. **Zero-insurance self-liquidation / force-realize stress** —
   PASS_SAFE. No meaningful insurance buffer; attacker still could not
   externalize net gains and vaults stayed synchronized.
8. **Minimum-position whipsaw rounding** — PASS_SAFE.
   One-unit position through extreme price oscillation did not mint
   rounding wealth or drain insurance.
9. **Fee-cycling wash trades** — PASS_SAFE.
   Repeated alternating trades with 1% fee burned value into insurance
   instead of creating rebate-like extraction.
10. **Many one-unit trades** — PASS_SAFE.
    100 alternating one-unit trades did not accumulate sub-unit
    rounding into net attacker wealth.

Stop condition reached: `10` consecutive `PASS_SAFE`; no new F-series
finding from this scan.

## Seventh pass — 2026-04-26 v12.19 hardened-public-path probes

Sweep targeted the recently-landed v12.19 surfaces not on MEMORY.md's
*Verified Secure* list:

- `c175ec4` — bounded-withdrawal deposits-only mode (new
  `insurance_withdraw_deposit_remaining` u64 + `insurance_withdraw_
  deposits_only` u8 packed into the prior padding slots).
- `83078bb` — wrapper-side rejection of `max_price_move_bps_per_slot
  == 0` before §1.4 envelope validation.
- `5e0b55c` / `b64d294` — §9.2 `check_no_oracle_live_envelope` and
  `permissionless_stale_matured` gates on the public mutation paths
  (`InitUser`, `InitLP`, `DepositCollateral`, `TopUpInsurance`).

### Code-reading findings (no new exploit)

- **Deposits-only mode**: 12 dedicated tests cover top-up/withdraw
  accounting (`tests/test_insurance.rs:1605-2152`). Every accounting
  edge I considered (bps masking, mode toggle attempts, third-party
  TopUpInsurance + operator drain, fee-growth left behind, corrupt
  flag rejection, cooldown, anti-Zeno floor) is already exercised.
  `UpdateConfig` does NOT expose `insurance_withdraw_deposits_only` or
  `insurance_withdraw_max_bps`, so the mode is fixed at `InitMarket`
  for the slab's lifetime. PASS_SAFE.
- **§9.2 reachability**: with the wrapper's `permissionless_resolve_
  stale_slots <= max_accrual_dt_slots` invariant, the
  `check_no_oracle_live_envelope` `CatchupRequired` gate on
  `InitUser` / `TopUpInsurance` is structurally shadowed by
  `permissionless_stale_matured` (`OracleStale`) on the steady-state
  path. §9.2 is reachable only after a partial `CatchupAccrue`
  advances `last_good_oracle_slot` ahead of `engine.last_market_slot`
  (covered indirectly by the F1 partial-catchup regression). The
  shadow ordering is correct: the matured gate is the operator-
  visible "market is dead" signal; §9.2 is the structural backstop.

### Fresh loop iteration

1. **Target:** Public-path stale-matured gate
   (`permissionless_stale_matured` on `InitUser` and
   `TopUpInsurance`).
   **Attacker model:** attacker (or honest user with stale UI) tries
   to move tokens into a market that has already matured into the
   permissionless-resolve window. Goal: leave funds stranded behind a
   resolution flow they did not anticipate, or pad insurance ahead of
   resolution to skew payouts.
   **Probes:** `tests/test_envelope_gate.rs::
   test_attack_top_up_insurance_rejected_after_stale_matured` and
   `test_attack_init_user_rejected_after_stale_matured`.
   **Disposition:** PASS_SAFE. Both probes fire `OracleStale`
   (`Custom(6)`) before any token movement; insurance is observed
   unchanged after the rejected `TopUpInsurance`. No previous test
   covered the negative case on either public path, so both
   regressions were kept.

Single-iteration pass; no new F-series finding. Returning the loop to
the user for next-target guidance per the "easy attacks out" stop
heuristic.

### Commands run

```text
cargo build-sbf
RUSTFLAGS='-Awarnings' cargo test --release --test test_envelope_gate -- --nocapture
```

Results:
- New envelope-gate regression file: PASS (`2` tests).

## Eighth pass — 2026-05-20 v16 per-asset oracle profile probes

Sweep targeted the v16 dynamic-asset oracle profile feature:

- asset 0 is the base asset and config-level oracle fields are only the
  asset-0 mirror;
- non-base assets store independent manual / EwmaMark / hybrid oracle
  profiles in the market account;
- retired slots can later be reactivated with fresh monotonic market IDs.

### Finding F8.1 — retired/reactivated slots must not inherit price-managed profiles

**Attacker model:** configure a non-base asset as EwmaMark/hybrid, retire
the empty asset, then reuse the same slot for a new monotonic market ID.
If the old profile remains, the new asset starts from stale EWMA/target
state rather than the activation price.

**Regression kept:**
`tests/v16_wrapper.rs::v16_wrapper_reactivated_asset_resets_prior_oracle_profile`.

**Disposition:** fixed. `UpdateAssetLifecycle::Activate` now writes a
fresh manual oracle profile for the activated slot.

### Finding F8.2 — retired price-managed assets must not refresh market liveness

**Attacker model:** after an EwmaMark asset is retired, continue pushing its
old mark profile to refresh `last_good_oracle_slot` and delay whole-market
permissionless stale resolution even though the asset no longer exists as
an active market.

**Regression kept:**
`tests/v16_wrapper.rs::v16_wrapper_retired_asset_profile_cannot_refresh_market_liveness`.

**Disposition:** fixed. `UpdateAssetLifecycle::Retire` clears the slot's
profile to manual, oracle reconfiguration is limited to active empty
assets, and EwmaMark pushes are limited to active/drain-only assets.

### Commands run

```text
cargo fmt
cargo test --release v16_wrapper_re -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
